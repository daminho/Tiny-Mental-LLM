what's it like coming off anti-depressants? I heard that if you're on them for longer than 3 months it's really difficult. You get brain zaps and all kinds of side affects. Is this true? Can somebody with experience please let me know whats it was like for you?,Does the poster suffer from depression?,yes
"I really need help making friends I'm 25, living with my parents. I recently quit my job, hoping to ease my depression but it only made it worse since I have nothing to distract me now. I lost touch with all of my high school friends after graduation, and didn't make any friends in college. I spend my days walking my dog, reading wikipedia articles, youtube, etc. I haven't spoken to another person since Monday. I just stay in my room and my parents don't come in. I don't have any hobbies, not even video games so I don't even have ""online"" friends. I have no friends or anybody to talk to. I realize this isn't a healthy lifestyle, and that I'm a loser. But I want to change. How do I meet people and make friends? When I meet people, what do I talk about?",Does the poster suffer from depression?,yes
"So dramatic 😪 My best friend and I were in the same school ever since we were 4 years old. But then, I had to leave for a different high school while she stayed with most of our friends. We didn’t grow apart, but we spent most of our time with different people, which can change a person. I’d like to think that I did not change a whole lot (probably true :’) ) but my best friend has been hanging out with some of our friends and they’ve been affecting her attitude in a way, and she’s starting to become the same people we would always laugh at for being stupid and ignorant and petty. We talked about it and she agrees that’s she’s changed, but doesn’t want her change to affect our friendship. What do you think we should do?",Does the poster suffer from depression?,no
"My dad's mad after game night. My family and I were playing board games two nights ago. We finished the first one which went well, it was fun. We switched to the second game that 4/6 of us had played before. After my brother finished explaining the rules my dad (who has played before) asked a really stupid question, so we thought he was joking. He then got really mad while we were answering his question, got up, and said he's not playing anymore. The next day we didn't say anything to each other. Today, we still haven't said anything to each other and he's clearly mad. Should i say something to him or let it pass?",Does the poster suffer from depression?,no
"My goal in life is to finally feel safe I'm at my boyfriends house. Been here a few days. I stay here every so often to escape my unstable home life, and hes all I have. I got a call from my dad. My childhood dog had to be putdown. Bone issues. Everytime I think of anything that gives me anxiety I feel the need to pick at my skin. My face is red and scabbed. I dissapoint everyone because I was the one destined to be smart and be the first (family name) with a degree and stable job. I turn 18 next month. No job experience. I get my photo id next week. Its very late because my parents lost my birth certificate. Set me back a lot. My mum is suddenly rushing for me to get Centrelink (welfare), so she can take half of each payment. We barely have food in the house most days because she uses her welfare on cigs and bills. I feel like I do nothing. Everyday is just nothing. In bed, video games, browsing internet, sex, video games, sad music and alcohol. Rinse and repeat. No joy. I want a social life and a hobby. I want a job. I want to not feel like im just laying down while everything falls apart on top of me. I want to feel safe and happy and like I give back and help people. I dont want to waste my life. I dont know why but I keep feeling like I'm going to die soon. I dont want to but its in my head. I dont want anxiety and i dont want to be pathetic and i dont want to be scared and i dont want to be bored and i dont want people hate me and i want to know what to do",Does the poster suffer from depression?,yes
"4 years Tuesday Tuesday will be the four year anniversary of when my dad committed suicide. My 21st birthday was this weekend and I got pretty drunk and started to think about it and I just cried and cried in the Uber with my friends. I’m really thankful for them. But there isn’t a day that goes by that I don’t think about him. The thing is, he was an asshole. To me and my mom. I didn’t know he was depressed, I just thought he was mean and didn’t love me. I really do think I could’ve prevented it if I’d known. I’ve been extremely depressed ever since it happened. I don’t think I’ll ever be normal again.",Does the poster suffer from depression?,yes
"Feeling trapped in my head First off I'm Autistic, I'm studying at Oxford I'm struggling to remember anything, like anything at all, people, faces, dates, facts, etc. I'm feeling more and more alone because I don't feel like I have anything good to think about. I have a girlfriend, she's in the forces and has a lot of structure and meaning to her life and I like that but I see my life as completely pointless. So about a year I was cycling in the dark and I was hit by a car, I flew over the bonnet and hit my head. I was out for about half an hour, till I regained conscience in the back of an ambulance, and the crews were cutting off my clothes and pumping me full of morphine. Before this accident I had a very good memory, and my parent would say I could talk about anything that had happened from when I was a child. I was having some weird relationships at the time with different people, and I only came out to them after I was in hospital for a month after the accident, I didn't want to say anything because I didn't want to worry them. I valued their feeling more over my own life, and I still do that now with other people. Things started to crash after the accident, I lost people really good friends and I knew it was me, and I changed and something during that accident had altered me, and I hated it. I started to forget people very quickly and events that had happened and horribly people who had died and continuously not realising they had died. That upset a lot of people. Before everything happened I had broken up with a girl (but i didn't realise that after), now I can't remember what we did together or even how we met, but I can't get the thought of her out my head, she later told me to leave never come back, which I did. But even now I still have the feeling of thought of her, and I'm struggling to get rid of that, I don't love her and I'm not in love her, I just feel like i'm obsessed with her a person I know nothing about and It haunts me. I've been to a few separate doctors and have been recommended medication, which I believe it has just made it worse. I've talk to my parents but they just talk highly of the pro's of medication and councillors. Hate councillors. (I always ended up lying to them) Since everything I've had some real down point, and made two attempts, by failed due to people walking in randomly either whilst in progress or while setting up. I've already made necessary precautions by writing letters, addressing them and stamping them but non have been sent. I want to tell my gf but I feel like, I don't want to throw feelings away by her thinking 'he's a sobbing kid, or he's crazy or why am I with him' - I'd rather hide it not to upset her, people mean everything in the world to me, and I'd give my life for her, any day. But I still want to tell her, and I don't her to be scared of me. When I close my eyes and think of a memory, I just see grey mist or static like of a television. It doesn't feel nice not having anything to fall back on in your mind, things that made you happy.",Does the poster suffer from depression?,yes
"Cried in a bathroom stall I'm not the type to post this kind of things, but I hate myself. I try my best to socialize, to be emphatic but I end up here every single time. Alone, boring and fucking depressed. Sometimes I think maybe I should be dead instead of someone else who had way better success at life than I did. I hate feeling this way and I take it out on my family when I can't control it. No matter how hard I try, socially I get nowhere, no friends, no relationships and no happiness. So here I am, if you guys know any sort of assassin hit me up, I might actually pay you to take me out. Save me the trouble of doing it myself. Peace out.",Does the poster suffer from depression?,yes
"I guess I’m done with her? Or is there something wrong with my attitude? So, in the Literature class, we did a practice exam paper and we had a peer assessment. One of my friend had my paper and it turns out she graded mine the lowest in the class. The teacher was actually surprised on her harsh mark and said jokingly ‘Hey, he (me) did all right. Isn’t that too harsh?. Later I approached to her to ask what was it that she gave mine a low grade. Then, she rants out all the things I’ve done wrong, but she spoke so fast that I couldn’t quite catch all of them. And I became a bit angry at her attitude because 1. She spoke so fast (so I couldn’t quite catch 30% of her points) which is likely to be intentional so I’m startled before I can argue back. 2. Majority of her points were about that I lacked explicit points, but the teacher ticked all the points and said they were explicit enough? So, I said back to her ‘Hey but the teacher said the essay was all right’ She scoffs and says: ‘Yeah, write like that in the real exam and you will totally pass. Who are you kidding?’ Now I wouldn’t really complain if she actually gave me valid constructive criticism, but she spoke so fast (likely to be intentionally) and most of her points came from simply her not reading carefully enough.. BTW, she actually achieves better grades than I do and is clearly smarter than I am. Not trying to be boastful, but in this Literature class, I really think it’s safe to say that I get better grades than her most of the times. And, she’s not a teacher. What the hell does she know better than the teacher to say things like that, especially when she gets lower grades than I do most of the time??? Besides, she really always says rude things in front of someone’s faces (and many many times in front of my face).. and she’s sometimes in her own world and can get really arrogant and cynical. I guess I’m done with her right? Or is there something wrong with my attitude? I regretted a couple of times being friend with her in the first place, and now I really see that there can be no good staying with her. And, I'm in my final year before graduation... I feel quite embarrassed that I'm complaining about this kind of friendship problem and I know I should be focusing on studying, but thinking about this gets me angry every time.",Does the poster suffer from depression?,yes
"Are my friends leaving me out on purpose? This has been bugging me for a while, I mean I've gotten to the point where I've made a Reddit account to vent about it. So I'm on of those girls who has two best friends, I'm sure you can already see where this is headed (I'll call them Susie and Amy). When I started secondary school I didn't have any friends since I had joined out with my school catchment area. Although, I met Susie and she quickly became my best friend. We were in a big group of girls which included Amy. Amy and Susie had become close since they lived near each other and had had lots of sleepovers and days out together and stuff. I had made friends with a girl called Ruby who was Amy's best friend at the time and eventually Amy and Ruby fell out, causing the group to split up and because I was closer to Susie, I went with her. This left Amy, Susie, and I to form a little ""squad"" and the three of us were extremely close for the next three years. Some things happened with Susie which resulted in Amy and I falling out with her for about 10 months. Nothing big, just usual girly bitching and drama. Amy and I became extremely close during this time but something Amy told me really hurt. When we were in the process of making up with Susie, Susie had told Amy that she considered Amy to be the closest person to her. That couldn't be right? I went to Susie's house every Friday? I helped her out with her chores whenever I was over, I stayed over almost every weekend, I went on trips with her and her family all the time, we sat next to each other in almost every class, we constantly texted and called and she wouldn't hesitate to tell me every detail of her life and problems and neither would I. Amy had a job and was always working weekends, she was also never the type to text people or even call since she was always with her sister. So why did Susie consider her closer? It really stung but I got over it. My issue now is that since the three of us have made up I can't help but feel a little excluded. I'll only give one example since everything's of a similar nature. We've been off school for the past three days because of the snow. I saw that Susie was at Amy's house on the first day, I was a little bummed about not being invited but I brushed it off since it could've just been a spontaneous visit. But Susie is at Amy's Mothers house today, I'm assuming she's staying over, and it's not like I live an hour away. I live a 15 minute walk away, it would only take 5 minutes to get a lift there and the snow isn't bad anymore. So...did I do something to warrant not being invited? Usually Amy would always invite me over, we would have loads of sleepovers... And y'know to top it all off, my Grandma passed away on Tuesday, Susie had met my grandma and visited her with me a lot and even though I had told her what happened she messaged me later to ask why I seemed sad, only to act shocked and say she 'never realised' that my grandma had died even though I had already told her. Amy knew my grandma had died too but she hasn't said a word to cheer me up. These girls aren't awkward or unsympathetic either, they've taken care of me when someone has passed away before. Are they being like this on purpose? TL;DR Close friends I've had for years are excluding me, is it on purpose or by accident?",Does the poster suffer from depression?,yes
"Religious difference between you and your child? Hi everyone! I am a doctoral student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and am conducting a research study on the experience of religious difference between parents and children. This experience is one that can be challenging and I hope to understand how parents make sense of it and ideally wish they could communicate about it.

If you are interested you can access the online survey at this link: https://ssp.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9GIVZe29RWXXe0l There is minimal risk of emotional and/or psychological discomfort because the survey will ask you questions about your religious difference with your child.

"Mother is always trying to start something. My mom and I have a rocky relationship, I love my mom but sometimes I absolutely cannot stand her or the things she does. It stems from her depression that she has, but she always blames everything in the world for her problems and never herself. Yesterday, she texted me that my grandparents were moving from our hometown they've lived in since the 80's and to the town where more of our family lives. I sent a picture of my discount card from my job and said they could use it if they needed to buy boxes or moving supplies. She replied with ""That's it no emotion?"" Should I have been more emotional to the situation? I don't blame my grandparents for moving because I moved out of state last year. I don't care what my grandparents decide to do because it's their decision to move. I don't blame them for moving at all.",Does the poster suffer from depression?,no
"This is the nicest group of people on the internet. I would come here everyday even if there wasn't so much helpful advice on here.

"How to end a friendship Hello I have two good friends male (27) and female (27) who are in a relationship with each other. We have been friends for almost 7 years now. 2 years ago, I (26) started dating my current bf (35). During that time, I was playing hard to get, and I was not really interested in my bf at the time so I would talk about him to my male friend who is in the relationship with my other friend. At one point, my friend told me that my bf is a sucker for love because he was chasing a girl that didn't want him...fastfoward...I accidentally told my bf that my friend called him a sucker and my bf said he doesn't want me being friends with him anymore. When my friend and I spoke about my bf, my bf and I were just dating, we were not bf and gf so I don't think my bf should taken it to the extent that I shouldnt be friends with him. Regardless....the point is that idk how to tell my friend that I can't be friends with him anymore...and if I'm not friends with him than his gf, which is my friend too, is not going to be my friends anymore...I feel bad because they are always asking to go out with us but they don't know the arguments I had with my bf regarding this matter.

"Sometimes I worry I let my mental illness be my excuse? It feels easy to justify staying up late, not eating properly... Not going out or not doing xyz; because I'm unwell. It feels impossible to differentiate between me being unwell and me not using it as an excuse. I feel like I know who I am when I'm well and I'm never awake at 5 am or failing a piece of work etc. But do I allow myself to trap myself longer by not trying harder? Letting it be an excuse? I've no way to tell really. I think I've been depressed so long now that I can't even remember what normal is. Or tell if my changes in character are related to being unwell or to me changing.

"Finding it difficult after college Hi. Im 23 and lately I've lost interest in everything. It kinda started last semester, I finished my masters and missed out on a 1.1 from a bad assignment, can't find any jobs relating to my degree and am currently stuck in a miserable retail job. Since the new year started everything has been getting tougher. I've been applying for PhDs, science jobs and anything that i could use my degree for, and everything Ive applied for I've been rejected from. My supervisor I was applying for scholarships with has kinda just abandoned me because I was declined from a competitive scholarship he wanted his project funded for. I feel like everything relates back that I narrowly missed out on my top grade so I'm basically an idiot. Since then I'm in a retail job where I get shouted at by customers every day. My roommate and best friend landed me saying she was leaving our apartment and ringing the landlord-literally out of nowhere-, so I've to leave the city and move back home. I've been prescribed antidepressants before but I found that they made me feel worse and I couldn't stay on them. I feel like I'm just stuck in a rut and I'll never get out. All my friends are either in phds or jobs that they like and I'm the only one in a miserable job. I've applied for another masters, the one I initially wanted before I got accepted into the one I degreed in, but I feel like it's just a waste of time. I have a family that loves me and a boyfriend and a few good friends I know care but I just find myself thinking that theyd be happier if I wasn't around. Everything I've tried to do has just been a failure and I've just lost interest in life. Some days I really don't want to leave my bed and just lie there because I'm just going to fail again. Sorry for the rant. TL:DR: finding myself in a rut I just can't get out of and have lost interest in life",Does the poster suffer from depression?,yes
"I am so fucking unbearably lonely I have no job, no friends. and nothing even close to an SO. I've never even been on a date. That's a pipe dream of course I wouldn't date someone as disgusting as me so why should anyone else in the first place. But I can't stop desperately wanting to be loved, to be touched. not even sexually necessarily tho that too, but just be held, kissed. Anyone, I don't give a fuck anymore boy or girl just someone anyone please It's never happened and it feels like it never will. I feel like I'm starving to death. I can't shake this need I've never really felt before and it's every damn minute. it's so damn funny though I shrink away from even the slightest of contact with another human, in the rare occasion I'm in public I bury myself in my phone and hope desperately no one acknowledges me. no one ever does but I'm always still afraid they will. how fucking pathetic, isn't it. add this to the list of things that make me wanna rip my skin open",Does the poster suffer from depression?,yes
"Bad Stepmom? I was married for 17 years to a man who refused to work and who sat and watched TV all day. I divorced him to find a better situation. I married my current husband on Sept 1, 2017. On 10/6/17 he lost his job. Now I feel as if I'm back where I started. I have to pay for everything. On top of it, he invited his 18-year-old daughter to move in with us without asking me, even though I'm paying for everything. Suddenly I'm paying for her groceries and everything else on top of his. Then, I'm informed by my husband that his daughter's boyfriend is going to spend every weekend here: Friday night through Sunday afternoon. Now I'm feeding him too. To make matters worse, the daughter and her boyfriend are loud and inconsiderate. They leave messes in the kitchen, living room, her room, etc. I miss my quiet house. Paying for him and I is more than enough. Am I selfish to not want to support her and her boyfriend too? I have a house in a different city but he refused to move there because my young adult kids live there. So I have to pay for 2 households because he refuses to move there, yet I have to live with his daughter. I'm about ready to run back home to my other house and call this quits.

I dont want to kill myself. I just don't want to exist I dont want to exist. I dont want to deal with all these emotions. I hate myself. I know people around me would no doubt benefit with me gone.

"I will never be able to take care of myself, let alone anyone else. I physically can't find the energy to even do the most basic things, like laundry, showering, and eating.

They always end up dying before I even realize. I don't even know how I'd be able to take care of a pet, let alone any kids. It's a really good thing I don't want kids, because I'd be a terrible, neglectful mother. I'd hardly have any energy to make them food, let alone entertain them.

"Advice please. Am I in the wrong or is she overreacting? This is going to be a long post! This is my very first post! Me (F33) and, now ex best friend (F33) just had a major falling out and she’s blaming me. Here’s a little backstory; We were best friends, did everything together, babysat each others kids and just hung out all the time. I have 5 kids, she has 2. My youngest are 19 month twins, her youngest is 9 month old girl. I babysat last for her on Nov 1st. Before dropping her baby off, I always vacuumed because she spent all of her time on the floor. Nothing dangerous in her reach (obviously, I Baby proofed for my kids). She was rolling around and got over by my shoe rack and found something I didn’t see and, like babies do, she stuck it in her mouth. I went over to her and did a finger sweep to remove it but I couldn’t get it and it made her gag; not choke, gag. So I angled her down, patted her back and it fell out. She smiled at me when I turned her right side up, obviously unfazed by what just happened. I stayed calm, and did what needed to be done, no harm. Told mom about it and she seemed unfazed as well and stayed and chatted and left shortly after. Thought everything was fine until just a few nights ago. She sends me a text; that’s right, a text, and basically tells me that I can no longer be trusted to watch her kids and that the state of my house should’ve been a red flag. (My house is lived in, not a pig sty). She said I dropped the ball and let her kid stick something in her mouth and she could’ve choked. Also, I was so nonchalant about telling her about it and that means I was lazy and didn’t see it as a big deal. News flash- it wasn’t a big deal, nothing happened. She said she wants me to apologize for putting her daughters safety at risk and that basically this friendship is over. I’m sorry but if it’s safe enough for my twins it’s safe enough for her daughter. She found something that I couldn’t see from my view point and stuck it in her mouth. I stayed calm, responded and everything was fine. Should I apologize? Did I do something wrong? She is refusing to talk to me face to face. I don’t feel like I should apologize for something every baby does. I just can’t believe she held onto this for so long. We’ve even hung out since then and she never said anything. Just some advice please.",Does the poster suffer from depression?,no

"Can depression impede articulacy? Obligatory I've been living with depression (BP2) and anxiety for much of my life as a young adult. It's been stronger than it ever has the past year and a half, and I've noticed many things about myself that aren't in line with who I thought I once was. One of the most significant is how I sound to myself and others.

"Does Trading Help Your Depression? Maybe I am a bit weird in this regard, but I do quiet well in this regard. I have not traded too much because of life circumstances, and thus the past few years have been depressed, as my one best friend is in jail and the other has adopted asceticism. I also moved to a new area and broke up with my ex. I have been thinking stuff over, and even though winning at coding can make me slightly happy, I feel like whenever I am trading I am on fire and feel like my ""true"" self, whereas otherwise I feel blah. When I mean trading I mean medium term investing based on value investing. IDK if the risk and reward part overruns me, but when I think about that I don't think about my lack of dating or how this or that sucks, I focus on kicking ass and taking names.

I don't really know how to start this, since I'm kind of new to this subreddit, and reddit in general, but I guess I'll try to say this all without embarrassing myself or something of the sort. Lately, I've just been having a tough time, especially since it's the last week before exams in my school. I don't feel any pressure to be doing well at studies anymore, but I do have one friend who *does,* and occasionally, he'll ask for space or something during stressful times so that he doesn't end up lashing out at me, but now, it's just making me feel incredibly lonely. I hate having to watch everyone else give hugs and stuff and just have a good time with their friends while I just keep having to give my friend space. I get that we put this in place to avoid having feelings hurt, but now it just feels... restrictive? It's all kind of hard to describe coherently, and my mind feels all jumbled up, tbh.

"I wish I was 15 again, when nothing really mattered I'm 21 now and all I want is to be 15 again, when I didn't have any worries, when I didn't know what depression was, when I had interests, when I didn't have existential crisis, when I didn't question every little thing about myself, I was just able to BE. Not to say everything was perfect back then, but every year it starts feeling emptier and emptier. Even though my life has technically better, I feel so empty and dead.

"I need help Please help, I don’t know what’s happening and I can’t control my emotions. I’m losing it. I went to my mom’s house and when I got there, there were guests staying over that I didn’t know. I have very severe social anxiety so this is not good. When I called my mom before driving to her house, she specifically said that no guests were over and it was okay to come. She lied. I went inside the house and asked my mom about the guests, she told me that she intentially lied to me because she wanted me to come over and knew that I wasn’t going to come over if there were guests there. I freaked out. My mom completely disrespected my boundaries and said the equivalent of “fuck your social anxiety, do what I want” I quickly left the house and went back into my car. I wanted to leave there because I knew I couldn’t handle socializing with other people. However, my mom followed me back into my car and started to ask why I was leaving. I tell her that she lied to me and I can’t take deal with my social anxiety. She says she doesn’t believe my social anxiety is real (mind you, I’ve spent two month in a psychiatric hospital last year) and says she wants me to stay. I tell her fuck off and get out of my car but she doesn’t leave. At this point I don’t know what to do so I freak out. We have an argument for an hour. She’s not leaving my car and is yelling at me. We eventually decide that I should go to my sisters house to sleep. I leave but now I have so much anxiety that I can’t drive. I park my car in a nearby parking lot deciding what I want to do. I have so much anxiety at this point that I made a post of /r/suicidewatch but quickly deleted it. Then my mom calls me and eventually asks me if I am driving to my sisters house. I don’t respond to the question because I don’t want to lie, and she finds out that Icwas nearby. She freaks out. She accuses me of lying to her when I didn’t lie. She then takes her car and starts to find where I was. She finds me and then we have an argument for two hours. She keeps on yelling at me saying that I should come back to the house and “forget about my anxiety”. I tell her I wanted to go back to the psychiatric ward in the hospital and she says that I’m being fucking ridiculous and should stop thinking like this.

"Mom treats me like a stray cat and siblings like gold My younger brother and sister are 10/11 years younger than I am. We have an older brother but he no longer speaks to our mother and has t for about 5 years. I’m an adult now and I fully support myself and have since I was 18. As soon as I graduated high school and child support stopped, I was tossed out of my moms with nothing but garbage bags filled with my clothes. I was told I had to live with father even tho my mother had just bought a house with her husband and my youngest siblings. My stepfather never like me and always kept me separate from their family. They would go to dinner every Friday night and I had to stay home bc he would flip out and many other mean things. To my step dad, I was a stray cat who didn’t belong near his children. My mother never stuck up for me and stayed with him until I was in my mid 20s when he cheated on her and left her. I was raised dysfunctional but bc of that I long for a close, supportive family. Once he was out of the picture, I was able to create relationships with my sister and brother. My siblings are now in their late teens and I’m 26. I’ve struggled immensely on my own I had no choice. I could have 3 dollars to my name and my mother wiuld take it from me for coffee etc. if she picked anything up for me I had to give her the money ASAP. Soon as child support stopped, legit the day I graduated i had to live with my dad and mother gave me only garbage bags with clothes. good. Anything that had been mine was now my sisters (bedroom set, jewelry stand, American girl dolls list goes on. Now years later, my mother makes sure my brother and sister have everything and anything the very best of. Designer everything, newest clothes shoes, technology. When it comes to me, my mother doesn’t do anything at all. If she buys the coffee I am to give her to $2 but reversed she would die if I asked for the money back for he coffee. Now foremost, I’m fully aware I am an adult and can support myself. It has nothing to do with what my mother does for siblings it’s how she treats me compared to her treatment of siblings. For instance, I asked to use sisters perfumes that smelled good and was told no it’s her expensive kind. I’m not to use anything of my brother or sisters actually. My brother s d sister themselves do not care about this stuff it’s just my mom. When cleaning my face, my younger brother is allowed to use my sisters face cream or anything really bc well they are siblings. But i am not allowed to use the very same thing. If my mother is getting rid of things she will charge me full price. If she orders pizza and I eat a couple pieces I have to pay her half the money. Point I’m getting at is that she treats me like im not good enough to use my sister expensive designer perfume or face wash etc. she can buy the best of the best for them but charges me if I need anything. Holidays she spends thousands on them and if she does anything for me she only gives me gift she receives for free for spending so much as PINK etc .im not expecting to be equal. Again I’m an adult and can buy myself things but she can’t spend even $25 on a gas card or something lol I should add that it is expected of me to get her and siblings expensive gifts for their bdays and Xmas. Moms bday is in January if I happen to be broke and can only afford a $25 dunkin card, my bday in February she will get me something small or a $5 dunkin card. If I can’t afford a gift, she makes damn sure my bday co es and goes without her buying bday gift. Immature or not I’m very hurt by this. I was always a good kid, never in trouble, finished high school, went to some college and never asked for hand outs.

"Am I Depressed or is it something else? This seems like a dumb question because to an extent I know I'm depressed but not to a clinical level. Like I hate the situation I'm in. I hate being in debt. I hate living where I live. That sort of thing. However, I'm not unmotivated. Like at all. I'm not hopeless. I'm not suicidal in any way. I'm terrified of death in fact one of my biggest fears is that I'll get so depressed that I'll become suicidal which is weird, I know but the point is, nothing in me wants to die. That being said, I'm tired all the time. I mean physically exhausted. Which seems to contradict major depression. I get up every day, shower every day, though I don't really want to go to work I go to work and do work with no issue (it's more that I don't enjoy my job that much on most days honestly some days it's super fun it's just one of those things it really has to do with the fact that I'm older and I'm not doing what I thought I'd be doing by this point in my life more than I hate my job). I can't think of many reasons why I'd be this physically exhausted all the time. Literally every doctor says ""You you are just massively depressed"". No, I don't believe I'm depressed to the degree that it makes me physically exhausted. If I still have plenty of hope for the future, want to get up, want to get dressed, want to shower, want to look good...how is this major depression to a point where I'm also tired all the time? Is it possible to have some major depressive disorder and not be hopeless and still be motivated to work hard and try new things? Because if it is, someone needs to tell me that. Any time a doctor tells me I must be depressed if I'm so tired all the time and I tell them that I'm not hopeless or suicidal or unmotivated then they go, ""Oh well I don't know what it is then"". I'm very annoyed with this because I never used to be physically exhausted like this before and doctors seem to just dismiss it as depression when I'm positive my depression isn't so bad it's ONLY making my physically exhausted and not having any other emotional affect on me. I'm frustrated so, if anyone can answer this it'd be helpful so I can see what avenue to pursue next.

"My story, i have to get this off my chest. Life sucks Hello everyone, This is a post about my life basically, i just need to get this off my chest. Its a long post but i just have to do this. Let me introduce myself first. Currently im a 19yo boy who turns 20 in March, I live in Belgium (grammar will be bad sorry). I have 1 older brother, 2 loving parents who are still together. And oh yeahh i have a very cute pupper as well. Financially everything is fine. Basically a family some people only can dream for. I mainly play on nintendo consoles (switch, 3ds, gba, n64) and the MMORPG runescape (dont laugh :)) I consider myself a extravert to my friends but an introvert when im talking to girls (lol) or strangers. I've always had a rough time fitting at school. Our elementary school was VERY SMALL, it only had 75 kids (including kindergarden). I was always the ""odd one out"", but because it was so small i had 1 friend. We played alot together and it was a ok time really. but when i was 5 most people around me started to notice that i made weird random noises. And that i made small movements with my shoulders (unnatural ones). Friends got annoyed, parents got annoyed, everyone got annoyed. Eventually my teacher screamed at me telling me to shut up, RIP ME. Eventually mom took me to a specialist and it turned out i have Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, if you youtube this you will get extreme cases where people shout fuck and ass, and move uncontrollably all over the place. THIS IS NOT THE CASE WITH ME. I think Tourette affected my life ALOT (it still does!!). I was always a really shy kid until i was 11, i started to accept my tourettes and was a happy 11yo. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **HIGH SCHOOL** (from 12 to 18yo, its devided in 6 ""classes"". This is where the problems started, when i just started high school i was scared but excited like everyone. Unfortunately for me i got the SHITTIEST bullies in my class. I had no friends in year 1, they made fun of me becuz of my tourettes (i didnt tell them becuz they wouldnt understand). It got to a point where i just smacked someone on the head with a baseball bat. Teachers knew of my situation so we both got 1 week detention. I was ""depressed"" during that year, you know the teenage life, its hard. Year 2 they changed me to another class and they were OK. They didnt bully me but they didnt talk to me either. They just left me alone really, during those 2 years i had 1 friend who i talked with but he also had his own friends. So most of the time i was alone. But that friend had no common interests, so i ended up playing runescape all day, u can talk with other players there and i had plenty of friends in there. It felt awesome to have friends and i spent all my time there neglecting my studies. But somehow i passed the first 2 years lol. I thought year 1 was bad, but then i met year 3 (different school). I got bullied even more in this class, they called me names, ignored me, humiliated me in class and started bitching if they had to sit next to me. Luckily they never got fysical with me (idk if thats the right word). In the middle of that year I decided in the middle of the fucking winter (it was snowing) in morning to take the bus (mom was always home and it was near our house) and to step of early. Spent 2 hours in a small freezing cold chapel playing on my nintendo 3ds, go to my house after mom left and spend playing games in my room. After 3 days the school called, my mom found out. I was stuck and told her everything about the bullying, about me feeling like absolute shit and that i had no motivation to go to school. She let the teachers know, went to school, got me to a psychiatrist. The bullying stopped, but they still ignored me, i still hadnt any friends and i still didnt feel any better. I somehow survived the 4 next months and passed. If i had 1.1% lower in total i would have failed that year. The only way i felt better was with playing runescape. YEAR 4-6 IS IN THE SAME CLASS WITH THE SAME PEOPLE, in year 5 three people joined Year 4 kinda went the same as year 2 believe it or not. The classmates were ok, they didnt bully me, they talked to me when needed but that was it. I spent my time with some kids i met on the playground. But u know they were those kind of friends u just spent time with becuz nobody else is around. They never invited me to go to parties or to hang around or anything. This year was also the 1st year i told them about my Tourette Syndrome ( i got some damn weird looks at times and i didnt even realize i was making sounds). They understood, they acted more nice to me, i didnt feel left out so much but was still unhappy. And on runescape i got into a community (clan), made some good friends there. It was the only place in the word i was truly happy. Year 5, same class as last year. 3 people joined and 1 of them became a friend of mine. To be completely honest he is still one of my best friends today, but i come back to that later. Lets call him J, Ok so now i had a friend.

"Debunking “stigma” Everybody who questions psychiatry often gets the response “you’re stigmatising people with mental health issues” What’s more stigmatising? Telling people they have biologically broken brains with insufficient brain chemistry, and bad genes?

Subjecting people to isolation and distancing themselves from people as “different” due to “mental illness” and subjugating the “norm” from the “mentally ill” subjecting people to drug trials they have ended up in suicide and mass homocide, all for the progress of “psychiatric medicine” Telling people that they have biological genetic brain diseases like “schizophrenia” and they’ll never really live a normal life. Yet we’re the stigmatisers?

"Writing out my feelings in hopes of gaining some sense of catharsis I'd like to start by saying I don't think I'm a danger to myself. I'm tethered here pretty strongly by my family and my best friend. I can't see myself leaving them, because I've seen what it does to people when those closest to them go. I resent the fact that I can't go, at times, but there's nothing to be done about it really. Most of the people in my life only ever knew my outer shell. The somewhat false personality that I put on in order to function. Over the last three years my mask has been crumbling away and the results haven't been pretty. It's been a viscous feedback loop that leaves me feeling worse and worse as people fall out of my life one by one, either by their own choosing or because I distance myself to hide my pain as I become less and less able to handle it. The summer after my sophomore year I was in the darkest place of my life. I had to pull out of university and move home to get therapy. It was actually very effective, and my junior year was a home run. I was getting the highest test scores in STEM classes with 600 students, I was killing it in my philanthropic efforts, and I had more friends and social obligations than I knew what to do with. My senior year I spent the fall studying abroad in France. It was magical. I fell in love for the first time. I wasn't reciprocated, but the thing I learned about love is that it doesn't have to be reciprocated to be the most beautiful thing you've ever felt. When I got back from France, the seeds of my current ruin were planted. All throughout college I'd been heavily involved with a camp for kids whose parents have cancer. I did it because my dad had cancer when I was a little kid, and the people I met were all wonderful, but most of all because the only thing that gives me a sense of purpose is helping other people. It drives almost everything I do. This camp gave me a rock that I could cling to through the worst of my emotional storms. The two directors of the camp were both new my senior year. While I was in France, one of them dropped out of school due to her own struggles with mental health. The director that was left over was completely overwhelmed, and entirely ineffectual. People left and right were telling me that I should take the open position. I didn't want it; I have ADHD as well as depression and I was so anxious about my lack of organization. Camp was in such a hole though, and for the sake of my friends and my campers and their families I did the only thing I felt like I could do, and took on the directorship. It was rough. My co-director continued to do little of anything, and I felt like I was juggling grenades. I couldn't fuck this up. Kids I'd been mentoring for years needed this camp to cope in a healthy way, and for a number of parent couples, the week of camp was the last time they got to spend alone together before one of them would pass away from cancer. My grades dropped a whole point, on average. My volunteer research suffered, and I really let down the post doc I was assisting (Sorry Bethany). My mental health took a nosedive as well. I made camp happen. It was ugly and bumpy and unorganized, but I made it happen. I took solace in the fact that the kids didn't seem to notice the flaws, but it didn't do a lot good for my relationships with the other volunteers. I redoubled my efforts at the beginning of my 5th and final year of college. I moved into a house with some of the other volunteers who I was closest to. I had to quit my research, and I couldn't keep my grades where I wanted them, but camp planning was progressing well, especially after our national organization took notice of the lack of effort on my co-director's part and added a third director, my friend and newly minted roommate A. A helped enormously, but I still had so much on my plate. To cope with the stress, my drug use started to skyrocket. I was smoking weed and cigarettes all the time, and to keep up with all my biochemistry coursework and 8-10 planning meetings a week I was taking my prescribed adderall more often than I should have been. I became thoroughly addicted. In my final quarter of school, everything really fell apart. I was completely overwhelmed, and became less and less effective at my job. I put A in the exact position that I had been in the previous year. I could feel him resent me more and more every day, but I was too ashamed to talk to him about it, and he never asked me how I was doing. I barely graduated. As soon as school was over I quit adderall cold turkey, because it had been putting me in a very dangerous mental headspace for weeks, but until then it had remained a necessity. The withdrawals hit me like a truck. Getting out of bed felt like a truly herculean task. I was an empty husk of a human being and from graduation to camp in August I contributed almost nothing to the camp. I had nothing left to give. A hated me by that point. He began to tell people what he thought of me, and they listened. I watched helplessly as some of my closest friends and roommates began to look down upon me, if not for what A was saying then for my severely depressed behavior.

"My depression is getting worse And the bad thing is that I already did all the things that someone would say to a depressed person. I've talked to a lot of psychologists (for about 5 years or maybe more), psychiatrist, I've been on antidepressants meds, I Meditate every day,I have been on several nofap periods (I broke a lot of streaks btw), I do physical exercise (I used to be a gym rat) and when I'm out I try to be social (I'm out basically only when I go to work or to the gym). But still my life is shit, I don't have friends, neither a gf, social interactions with women are nearly 0 and I think that all of them are bitches.

"How to get over my ex best friend Ok so all throughout high school (I graduated high school 4 years ago) I had a best friend. We were sisters literally thought we would be friends forever. We graduated I got into my first relationship and we drifted apart and she never really let me know how she felt. She told me one day she wishes I would stop talking about him so much and that kind of was like ok cool that kind of sucks but not a big deal. Being in my first relationship that I’m currently still in it sucked not being able to talk about it because I was so excited. Anyways months passed and we got into an argument and basically we ended our friendship because she thought I was an awful friend because I was too busy for her. Fast forward a year after that we started talking again (I reached out, I always do) we started being “friends” again but it felt so awkward. Honestly though she’s the only one who was ever angry and made things not feel the same. On her 21st birthday she invited everyone to her party at her house but me and told me it was because we didn’t talk much and she didn’t want awkward vibes at her house. After that I just unfollowed her on social media and we didn’t talk at all. I messaged her over the summer congratulating her to see she was taking a trip to China and then she messaged me on my birthday. This all happened in 2017 so our friendship has been fucked up for like 2 years now. Because I deleted her number a while ago I decided to reach out and talk to her on Instagram saying happy birthday and hope she was doing well and she never replied and I know she saw it. So our friendship is dead. I’ve known it’s been dead too for like 2 years now but how do I stop being so damn hurt? I think it hurts even more because she truly doesn’t give a fuck and she was my best friend ever. I wish I could go back and do something else to fix it. Idk lately I’ve cried so much. I haven’t been able to find a good friend like her again even though she wasn’t THAT great. How can I stop obsessing over our friendship and just let it go? I constantly look at her Instagram to see how she’s doing and it just really sucks. :(",Does the poster suffer from depression?,no

"Best friend drifting away? I've debated whether to post this or not for ages. My best friend is like my sister and has been there for me through really hard times, and I've been there for her. We're similar in so many ways, run a small blog together and I love her to bits. On new years eve she was set up with a guy and they've been dating ever since. Since their first date, we hardly talk. She doesn't even want to talk about him much, and when she does she talks about quitting her job for him, and that he wants to spend the rest of his life with her. They go out drinking a lot, almost every night, it seems like he spoils her and she's told me she's really happy. But at the same time her anxiety is still bad. She's lost her ambition to travel, adventure and take up new hobbies. She doesn't contribute to the blog anymore but says she still wants to carry it on (our domain doesn't expire until July). I feel like I've lost my best friend, but I'm mostly scared that she's already lost herself because of a guy and I just don't know what to do. I've stopped chasing her for plans because she's always busy now (we used to meet up weekly), and stopped messaging because there won't be a reply. She checks up on me every now and then and I haven't been doing well at all, but I don't want the few times we talk to be negative and depressing. I just feel so clueless right now and I miss her.

"I have no idea what to do My husband and I got into an argument last night that has lasted until this morning. Through out the entire argument, he has called me horrible names and hurt me deep. I thought i was almost over my depression, I thought i was getting better, but the things he has said has taken me from where I thought I was all the way back down to extremely emotional and having suicidal thoughts. The argument started because I was talking too loudly to his son while trying to correct his behaviour. I am 38 weeks pregnant, and lately have been easily annoyed and upset by the boy not listening to me. My husband called me a bunch of hurtful things because I tried to explain why I was so upset. Later on in the night he told me my mom and oldest sister were no longer allowed to visit me for the birth of our child. Then he spent several more hours talking about how they were ""rot gut whores"" and how he doesn't want them around HIS son all because 2 years ago my sister invited me to a christmas dinner she knew I wasnt going to show up for and didn't specifically include my husband in the invitation. Yet his mom is coming a few weeks after, and she had left him and his brother to fend for themselves in a trailer in the middle of a forest only showing up to bring them food when they called her and begged her for it. But because she ""hasn't done anything to offend"" me, he is totally ok with her showing up. Now he's talking about how if I want my mom to be here so bad, I can leave with her when she visits. And I've fully expressed how depressed I am to him and he isn't even worried in the slightest. He just keeps refering to my past as a teen who would sleep with practically anyone to try to get some sort of pleasure out of life, saying he bets I want to go back to that, that i would treat his son better if he were black, and that i would try harder to not upset my husband if he were black.

"I was rejected &amp; I feel great Last night I asked a close friend of mine on a date and was rejected, but strangely enough I don't feel dejected but rather proud and accomplished. To provide some background, I'll be turning 20 on the 15th, and last year, just 4 days after my 19th birthday, I was diagnosed with Persistent Depressive Disorder. This disorder is characterized by long lasting, essentially uninterrupted periods of depression lasting AT LEAST 2 years, and in many cases, such as with myself, far longer. To provide a rough estimate, I have been depressed somewhere around a total of 13 years of my life. The depression has had a serious negative affect on my love life, at times making me cold and even cruel. The most egregious example of this was when, after having dated this girl for a few months, I stopped talking to her almost entirely and started flirting with other girls. Eventually she had to get her friend to break up with me on her behalf because I was refusing to talk to her. At the time, because of the depression, I thought little of myself, seeing myself as a worthless scumbag, and so I started acting like one. I was also afraid to open up to some else, so instead I became emotionally cold and avoidant. I hated this behavior in myself, and held a deep guilt for how I had treated women I had been with, so about 5 years ago I stopped dating entirely. Despite being rejected, having finally had the confidence and self respect to ask out a woman and accept the no graciously is a major growth in my self esteem and wellbeing, so having done so I feel a great sense of accomplishment. This has really helped boost my self esteem and confidence, even though I was rejected. There's no real point to this story, but I just wanted to get this out there, because I'm really proud of the progress I've made so far.",Does the poster suffer from depression?,yes

"relationship with sister falling apart, different memories, need advice Hi, In a nutshell - my sister (both about 30years old) has been accusing me of saying various horrible/bad things, often saying I said it seconds ago, sometimes hours ago and getting angry with me.

"I checked myself in to a Mental Hospital I decided after dealing with months of annoying suicidal ideation that I should go to a mental hospital. I say annoying because I was aware of these increased thoughts and wanted nothing to do with killing myself. While I wanted a closed environment away from home stressors to solve my issues I was also afraid of going somewhere unknown. I went through with it (despite crying and feeling emotional on the way there) to get my life turned around. I feel very often that horror stories are told of hospitals. In reality, if you need the help, please seek it out. You may have a completely different experience than someone who claims they don't remember their stay and was drugged up to their eyeballs. My experience was a pleasant one overall. I went there and focused on fixing my issues and I'd say I came out feeling better. I'm not sure if I can or should give the name of the place but I'm sure someone can let me know down below. I just want to share my experience and help people not feel so afraid of going to one. The place was pretty clean. An adult area for people 18 and over, rooms and halls split by gender. Bathrooms only seemed a bit off towards the end of the day or during the morning when people would shower. Roommates were sweet and tidy thankfully but the option to change roommates if there was a problem was always available to me. Groups were informative and engaging as well as encouraging for others to speak up if they wished. You had a good amount of personal time to do whatever. Outdoor activities were available permitting the weather. The place was meant for short stays of up to a week so anyone who's still there for longer may see the groups as too repetitive. The food was surprisingly delicious and great. Honestly expected school lunch type of food but there was variety and options for those allergic, vegetarian or needing gluten free food. There were staff members around whenever you needed them for anything. The treatment team could've been better. They were good to me but not to everyone there. Changed meds without informing me. I went from 5 to 10 to 15mg of Abilify. Good Lord I felt it once I was home. Then REALLY felt it when they made a mistake and I went cold turkey for two weeks because I couldn't get my prescription filled. I'll update once I'm properly back on it. So that's my experience. After a week, I came out feeling better. I got off of Wellbutrin after determining it could be the cause of my increased depression. The Abilify gives me energy to get up and not be stuck in bed all day. I feel better than when I went in. I know this is a long post, however I've been afraid of sharing my experience with others.

But since I've always been the one to do everything, he's used to sitting on his overweight ass all day playing video games. Now that I'm a full time college student, I don't have time to do things around the house that I could before. He refuses to do anything including even fixing his bed. I tell my mom ALL the time to do something but even if she does, he'd throw a fit. I seriously think he just needs to be put on medication because his behavior is very VERY out of control. We've been arguing and fighting so bad daily for the past year or two and it's just getting progressively worse. I don't know what to do. I seriously would move out right now but that's not an option as I don't have time to work a full time job and take 17 credits while paying for schooling AND rent/utilities/gas/etc. It's just becoming such a toxic place to come home to that I just stay at the library or starbucks because I dread coming home because I know he'll always start something, but even when I do come home it's always yelling and fighting even if I bite my tongue and stay silent. He DOES NOT LISTEN!!! He thinks HE'S in control. If he were my child, I would've taken every possession he has (iPhone, Xbox, etc) and made him sit in his room all day being forced to read a book and learn to respect people older than him! He talks back to my mom A LOT, and the thing that makes me mad is we won't even do anything to him. I know people will be trying to say, ""Well maybe don't try to boss him around"" but the thing is I DON'T. I'll just be like, ""Make sure you clean your half of the room"" or ""Be sure to take the dog out"" or ""Make sure you unload the dishwasher"". I don't know what to do anymore. I think I'm gonna force him to go sleep in the basement because I haven't even gotten a full nights rest since summer and I feel like I'm starting to get depressed. Every day he's always calling me names, and it gets so bad that I have to call him something back in order for him to even realize what he's saying to me. I'm just so over this and this extra stress is seriously making me feel nauseous trying to balance school along with it. I've tried talking to a few people about this, but all they say is, ""Awe it'll get better"". WELL AT THE RATE IT'S GOING NOW, IT WONT. I just don't know what to do. It would be a lot easier if I had my own room so I could get a quiet space for privacy and alone time away from him.",Does the poster suffer from depression?,no

"My boring sob story Family members told me all the time that being an adult is shit and I should make the most of being a kid. So when depression hit me I thought it was normal, but it didn’t feel “right.” I wasn’t upset all the time, it was just like a flat misery sort of feeling. Things started to feel odd for me, certain sounds and smells and silly things like the wind of my face felt wrong. Like they’d be toned down somehow. Eventually I became completely disconnected from my emotions, save for the occasional moment when I actually find something funny. I’ve been on two types of medication and had therapy too, neither of which did anything for me. I didn’t notice myself become so gradually withdrawn from everything. Now going to the shop or getting the bus is something I’d rather not do. Things I’d do every day. My social life went backwards as well as my social skills. Now I’m afraid to talk to people. I literally reject girls I’m interested in on the spot, before I even have chance to fuck it up myself. Things that I would do without thinking now take encouragement and energy. Then came the cynicism. Belief that nobody out there was pure and everything they did was for their own personal gain. Suppose it’s true in a sense but I wish I didn’t have this “paint everybody with the same brush” mindset. It’s hard to believe I’m the same person at times. It’s been 7 years now and I’ve had enough. Just dunno what to do. I feel like I’ve tried everything. Can’t help but feel I’m partly responsible, for buying into the shit I told myself.",Does the poster suffer from depression?,yes

"Might have gotten my friend fired at work First of all: hello! I’m just gonna jump right in. So I (23/f) have been best friends with this girl (let’s call her maya) for about 3 1/2 Years now. Another girl (we will go with Ashley) became part of our group about a year later and maya asked us to start working at the restaurant she served at part time. Eventually, maya started a thing with this guy who was in a relationship at the time, so we obviously didn’t really put a lot of hope into the whole thing. But eventually he broke up with the other girl to be with maya. Now she started really getting into weed (like 3 blunts a day all by herself) and then dropping pills on the weekends. Ashley and I are not into it so we stayed away but tried to still hang out but it got more and more difficult being with her because she either a) fell asleep b) throw up all the time c) was just super uncomfortable to be around. Also work got fucking disastrous because she asked us to pick her up and every single time she either overslept or just forgot about it... so we were always late with her. Last week it really excalated: she left Ashley hanging for over an hour, didn’t pick up her phone, I cancelled all my plans to go to work instead of maya and or coworker was all by himself with a huge group of guests. And all she did was send us a voice mail telling us what we should tell our boss. (Not even a reason why all of it happened) Obviously, we were both really pissed and I just told our superior what had happened and why I was there instead of her. Needless to say he was mad and said that our boss has to talk to her about this because it obviously just a big no go. The issue is, she kind of expected us to lie for her and I don’t think I can deal with that anymore. She has become so enstranged lately and I don’t want to support her selfish and self-destructive behaviour. But now I guess I might have made her lose her job and i don’t know if I should apologise and try to talk our boss into letting her stay or just accept that she’ll hate me forever and go on with my life. I’ve told her that I don’t like the whole drug thing but she laughed it off, called me a coward and sheltered. But she also treats me (and Ashley to an extend) like her servants and all my other friends can’t stand to be around her. So really, i don’t know how to approach her with the whole situation because in the end I’m going to be the horrible friend that ruined her life. Should I apologise or/and try to damage control the whole thing at work?

"In a bad headspace after a breakup with someone who finally made me feel like things would be okay It’s been a week since I returned from a six month exchange program overseas. There, I ended a 2y relationship with an addict, who I still cared for but could not love anymore. Then, of course, I fell in love with someone. We were inseparable for the six months. As I struggle with depression, anxiety and schizoaffective disorder, it hasn’t been the easiest for him. We planned to end our relationship and continue as friends, but just couldn’t bear to at the departure gates. We decided to try a long distance relationship, but after a week, he’s had enough of me. He has his own problems, and we live 20 hours apart with a 12h time difference, so I don’t blame him at all. I do however carry a lot of resentment for myself for being so down in the past week and pushing him. I used to be really sociable, but a multitude of issues have led me to slowly isolate myself from people. I still have friends, but they either don’t actually gaf or they have their own problems and I don’t want to add on to their burdens. It’s also very difficult for me to meet people without any alcohol or drugs to calm the anxiety—something I’m trying to stay away from as my addiction problems have led me to the psych ward. Besides, how much can friends be there for you? It’s you alone in your bed staring at the ceiling til noon the next day for days on end (I’ve had terrible insomnia since coming home). I’m still on school break, cannot really occupy my mind by going outside to meet friends or take a part time job or just walk around due to anxiety and psychosis, and all the things I used to watch/do to cheer myself up (music, slam poetry, writing, youtube, netflix, games) I have associated very strongly with him as we have very similar habits. So anything that could make me pass the time makes me sad. I’ve loved and lost many times and I know it gets better eventually, but currently it gets very very dark in my mind and I’m not sure what I can do to survive in the meantime. I’m in a very bad place and feel very anhedonic and suicidal thoughts are back (having been accumulated from all these problems). He was the one person that made me feel like someone understood and was there in this big bad world, and without him I feel like I’m floating and nothing will make me feel okay again for a long time.",Does the poster suffer from depression?,yes

"Why is it so difficult to preserve wealth within a family for longer than one hundred years? Some family members can make fortune during their lifetime. Because they were lucky, or because they worked hard, or smart. It doesn’t matter. It is almost inevitable that after two generations passing the lucky one the third generation returns to the poverty with very poor financial background. There are always and always will be more failures than successful stories. Why is it happening? Because of mismanagement. There are no other reasons! Not because they are too old, too young, too tall, or too stupid… But, because they failed to create a system which can monitor, rule, manage, predict future successes and failures. Most families have no idea that such systems have been existing and successfully helping some families to do this job efficiently. Do those families share this knowledge with humanity? No way. Why would they do that? They literally rule the world, they have all the power and all the money. I’m fortunate to collaborate with some of those families. What if I ask you: Would it be interesting for you to uncover their secrets and to know how they do it? Would it be interesting for you to see a blueprint of their success? Many families are struggling in our society. They have no idea where they are going to and what goals they have. It leads to frustration, procrastination, apathy and depression. Because they have been caught in a daily routine. Day after day, month after month… No time to think, no time to plan, no time to review or set goals. In my opinion, this is the reality for 99,99% of the human population of the Earth. Is there a solution? Yes! But, you have to implement some strategies. It includes not only intellectual, emotional and spiritual development, but financial evolution also. Without a strong financial fundament, it is almost impossible to cultivate wealth in your family in a long-term run. To be continued. Rey",Does the poster suffer from depression?,no
Is it obvious when you have depression? I wonder if I have some form of mild depression or I just have low self esteem. I became a mute quite a few years ago after acouple of events that got me down. I think it may have been catatonia. But I'm not 100%. Ever since then I don't feel like I got back to my normal self. I'm a lot shyer and I don't have much luck socially or romantically or in my career. The best way to put it would be I lost my personality. I can really beat myself up sometimes because I hate myself. When something bad happens I really start self loathing quite badly. I don't feel suicidal. I hate myself more than I hate my life. I blame my lack of success on myself. I don't enjoy things as much as I used to so I have no real hobbies. I don't think I'm likable and I can't even pass interviews these days. I lost my personality and that's why I hate myself. I'm unrecognisable to who I used to be so I isolate myself a lot more these days.

"My Story of Elder Abuse: Internet Romance Scams and the devastating consequences I'm living a nightmare watching a woman 50 years younger than my 80-year-old father coerce him into marriage, manipulate him and taking his money all in the name of ""love"". The relationship started as Ghanaian romance scam (usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/romance-scams/) and after we uncovered it was a male in Ghana pretending to be an American woman, it eventually led to a Ghanaian woman residing in Cuba, showing up at my father's doorstep and coercing him into marriage two weeks later. The story is long, complex, and out of this world so I won't go into it here. We've tried it all: FBI, USICE/immigration, State Dept., AARP, private investigators, the District Attorney, police, adult protective services, elder abuse attorney's and filing for conservatorship. The harsh reality I'm learning is though the crime is so blatantly obvious to everyone, I'm told over and over by the authorities that individuals have the right to abuse themselves. My father is showing serious signs of dementia but his executive functioning is still intact and we cannot get him to see a neuropsychologist without a long and painful court battle. To the outside world, he comes across as just fine, but my normally mild-mannered, extremely rational and brilliant father has had explosive and violent episodes, personality changes, impulsive behavior, and has been unduly influenced and taken advantage of over an over again. He cannot see that people are lying to him even though the lies are later revealed to him. I've had a huge reality check just how powerful civil liberties to make bad decisions are in the USA along with the financial rights that coexist in marriage, no matter how corrupt. I'm not writing for advice since I know in my heart my father is not well and is no longer the father I know and love. What I want to know is if anyone else out there has experienced elder financial abuse in their family, and romance scams or partner abuse in particular. I want to hear your story. I am appalled that though financial elder abuse is rampant throughout the USA, and internet romance scams are only on the rise, there seems to be no major initiatives or policies to protect our vulnerable elders.

"overbearing family. I (19f) am living away from home for college in my 2nd year. However, I still feel very under the control of my mother. It is just me and her at home, and rest assured she has always done her best for me but recently I’ve had enough of how much she expects from me. I am studying for grade 6 piano and the fact is that I simply don’t have time for it. She wanted me to do the exam for it after only studying it for 3 months (bare in mind I only get to practice once a week as I have no piano away from home - I come home at weekends). When I postponed it she screamed at me for hours and called me an idiot and various other things. I told her I was too busy with college work, I got my results back for college and did very well; however, she still wasn’t happy. First comment was “maybe you’re not as stupid as we think” and then said that I could do a lot better, even though I did really well. I never leave the house when I’m at home for weekends or any holidays because when I go out or meet my friends she makes it very difficult as she usually starts a row before I leave and guilt trips me about going. I have been wanting a full time bar job for summer, as that’s where my experience is but she is even controlling where I work and telling me where to apply to. She keeps guilt tripping me about being away for college, and saying I’m on a permanent holiday. She is annoyed at me for having a boyfriend; she never uses his name only refers to him as “your friend” in a sneering voice, and she won’t meet him. She is by no means a bad person, she has always been a very good mother but the pressure she is putting on me is too much and I feel very restricted, and at times, controlled.

"I can't seem to be happy with my current life - only the future So I was diagnosed with mood swings/mild depression quite a while ago, and have been on a small dose of Fluoxetine (Prozac) most of my life now.

This last college semester was horrible on me, and I came out of it with depression and depression meds. I'm 19M in college right now. I thought it was pretty obvious, but I wanted to tell my friends about why I've been talking less and have been hermitting myself out a little. So the next time we're all together, I tell them that I have depression and that's why I'm taking meds and that's why I've gotten so quiet, ect. And... Barely any response.

The message said, and I can quote, that they ""don't feel safe around a mentally dark person"" in their house. Ok, what? Even better, the convo goes on and says that my group of friends were talking... And they don't want to, in quotes again, ""Associate with a mentally dark person"" as a friend. Like what the fuck?

"Money and power are your friend, not human beings! I am cynical about friendship from my recent experience. I am from a well-off family but I’d tried to live by my own and lived in a very tiny studio. To my well-off friends, I might look humble. They partied, traveled, and dined together without me, and kept those in secret (some of those events were blurted by mutual friends). Especially one of them frequently ignored me. When I really needed someone in order to be discharged from a hospital, that person didn’t help me even though she could - she didn’t even hide it. My parents didn’t like me living in a small place rent, so they bought me a very nice condo. Those well-off friends learned this news and they were excited about it. The woman who’d been ignoring me and hadn’t helped me out, volunteered to help my moving. I refused. When I had a house warming with them, they saw my place and was anxious to be invited to any of my future parties at this new place (yes, it’s a really nice place.) And then, they started to invite me to their exclusive parties and dining gatherings. They even asked me why I put some distance from them. It was ridiculous. Why did you guys act like you’d been caring about me so much? Life has taught me that my true friends are money and power, not human beings.",Does the poster suffer from depression?,yes

"I've been sleeping with my best friends girlfriend for 3 years?? I'd be lying if I said I don't feel guilty. But on the other hand I still do it. We have been seeing each other behind his back for about 3 or more years every other day. She tells me everything about them. How sex with him is awful. Which I knew already because he asked me what he should do about it. I gave him good advice. I guess it didn't change anything. The sex with her is amazing. I think it's how taboo it is. We're all over each other. She lets me do things to her that She won't let my friend do on her , like anal I was the first one to ever do anal and throat fuck her and STILL do it. She wants a relationship with me and there's no way in hell that's going to happen. She thinks that I'm in love with her and that we will be together. She talks about us running far away together. All I have to do is say the word. I'm a big believer in ""once a cheater, always a cheater"". But she seems to be in love with me. My gut is telling me shes in love with me. My gut is never wrong. I guess I'm doing both of them wrong. I know he uses reddit so I'm not going to give all the details. I also want to add that I still respect the guy a whole lot. I would hate to lose his friendship.

"Feeling insecure that my friend hates me I'm really stressing out right now. This happens all the time, I feel like my closest friend hates me. But recently, it's been getting bad. He's been ignoring me in person, taking forever to text back, and being really passive aggressive while texting me. It really hurts me that he does this, because he knows I have bad mental health, but he only makes me feel worse about it by making me feel worse about myself. This has been happening for the past three months, and I've had so many urges to tell him that we can't be friends anymore because he's hurting me so much. But I love him to death, when he is around, he supports me. But the moment he stops, he acts like I don't exist. It's tearing me apart. I'm scared to talk to him about it because I don't want him to hate me anymore than I feel like he already does, but I just don't know what to do about it.

Long story short about 3 months ago she had a 2 year anniversary with a guy but admitted she has a thing for me. So i waited it out and about 3 weeks ago they broke up so i thought 'hey, ill see if i can hang out with her and see what happens' nope. Told her i still feel how i did and she just says 'i see you as a friend and nothing more'. Maybe im just not cut out to be here, or to deal with people?

Ive been in a dark place for a long time but im the kind of person who channels this into humor so not even my family could tell. I just turned 20 yesterday and ive been depressed for about 2 years now. I havent opened up to anyone about it because i keep brushing it aside thinking it would pass but it just keeps getting worse. Today i realized something that made me genuinely cry, i seriously didnt remember the last time i was myself. I used to be super carefree and relaxed, i was full of energy and would answer any call to chill in seconds. I just asked my close friend when was the last time he remembers the real me and he said it was the beginning of college and im currently finishing my second year. Its been getting progressively worse in the last 6 months with a serious drop in my appetite. I also started feeling anxiety for the first time in my life and suicidal thoughts are uncommon Ive lost about 10 pounds in 2 months because of this. My grades also took a hard hit, going from a 3.0 gpa every semester to a 1.7. I just had a talk with my mom and she told me that im being ungrateful and that i need to get my shit together (ironic considering she suffered depression for years until i pushed her to divorce my father). Im not blaming her at all for my situation because she was raised by two hardasses so i understand why its hard for her to understand why a teen would be depressed. I know that life is worth it and it gets better but i really cant keep the darkness out of my head.

Will my relationship last forever? There's a good chance it won't because both of us are very young. However, that doesn't mean I don't know how to be in a relationship or know if I love someone or not.

She asked me this tonight over a phone call and I got upset with her and expressed how I feel uncomfortable and disrespected when she tells me things like that.

She's told me things like this many times before, and usually I try to just try to brush it off, but I'm trying to get her to understand and communicate better with me and my brother. She went on to say say ""but i'm your mom, I can ask things like that."" I understand she has a much different point of view, especially because she's older, but I just personally feel it's disrespectful to say that I don't love my boyfriend and that ""he's just a friend."" She kind of rolled her eyes at me, flatly said goodnight, and hung up. Am I overreacting? i feel like I shouldn't be guilty for expressing my feelings of being uncomfortable with the questions she asks me.

"My family might break apart... Sorry this is a long post. Yes I know this is common thing sadly. But I don’t want it to, 12 years my family have been together. Just to start off, There is me, my brother, my dad and mum. So my dad has anger issues. His parents never told him it was wrong so he has been like this all his life. Our mum is his second wife because his first wife divorced him for all the reasons I’m about to mention. We only listen to him because he rules out of fear, he isn’t teaching us anything, and is a bad influence on us. When he gets annoyed he yells really loudly on purpose for everyone to hear (including our neighbours) then drives off for an hour. He’s always threatening to me and my brother, “I’LL KICK YOU IN THE FACE”, “YOU’LL END UP IN HOSPITAL.” I’ve despised him for about 3 weeks and it’s actually a lot better when he drives off and vanishes. Problem is, he makes 80% of our money. My brother is slowly becoming like my dad.I’m trying to help him, my mum is trying to help him but it isn’t working. I believe he can still change because he’s still young (12). He yells at our parents trying to prove he is right all the time. Problem is, he won’t listen to us unless our dad threatens him and scares him into stopping. Heres the big problem, he is a messy person and our mum is a very tidy person, she tells him all the time clean up but he says, “I’ll do it later”, but never actually does it. So my mum and brother argue often about this. He says he doesn’t care about who he is becoming, but I know he does. Despite all the tension between me and my brother I still love him very much. My mum is the only reason our family is still together. She ends up stopping dad from slapping/threatening us and is the one that teaches me and my brother right from wrong. She’s basically carrying our whole family and I feel bad about it. I love her very much and I feel so much empathy for her. She was a good daughter and this is the life she grew up for. It’s sad, really. And me, I was also becoming like my dad, but ever since Mid 2017 I’ve had a fear of me or my brother becoming like him in the future. I’m using my words, I’m trying not to yell. I’m trying not to walk off after every arguement so I can tame my temper. I’ve slipped a few times, but this fear is actually changing me for the better. I’m telling my brother not to answer back to our parents but he won’t listen. I’m trying to help my mum because I feel sorry for her. So recently, it’s me and my mum trying to stop my brother from yelling at us, stopping our dad threating/slapping us. I’m trying to get my brother to see the future like me. So just yesterday, my brother made a light-hearted joke to my dad and he got mad and slapped him. Later that evening, our mum asked him why he did that. So he drove off and came back at 1am. After this, our mum and dad haven’t spoken to each other. This morning my brother keeps arguing his point to our mum, I try to support her. My dad has done nothing. All he did was wake up, drove off and come back at 7:30pm to sleep, then he drove off again. So just a few hours ago, my mum tells my brother to clean up. This causes a arguement. I support mum, but my brother won’t stop yelling. I told him to stop 3 times but he told me, “You don’t have the authority to tel me to do anything”. After this my mum asks me, “what should we do now?” Then I messaged my brother and things have been solved between us. Thats too much arguements for just 2 days, don’t you think? And my mum is right, what can we do? There’s too much problems with all of us, and we’re all depending on each other so it’s not easy. My mum would’ve divorced dad long ago if she had the money. I want me, my brother and mum to live together peacefully away from the bad influence of our dad. We haven’t called the authorities because my mum is afraid of what will happen to our dad. We haven’t got outside help because our parents think it’s embarassing. So, what choices do we have?",Does the poster suffer from depression?,no
"Telling my bestfriend she's long winded without hurting her feelings? My bestfriends and I have been bestfriends for about 2 1/2 years.

She tells me the same, or similar stories a lot and has to give me all types of insignificant details that prolong her talking.

"My husband is not my best friend. Friends jealous of friends. My husband isn’t my best friend and that’s ok. In fact, it’s more than ok. Yes, he is my friend but our connection is deeper than that. We are building our lives as one. Sharing our day to day, filling them with constant support and security. I love my husband deeply but we are also different people. He plays video games and I do arts and crafts. He watches war movies and I go to brunch. I value my friendships &amp; consider them a priority in a different light than the priority my spousal relationship takes. Because of our many differences, I take and make the time to build on my friendships. If their partners are their best friends, I am truly so happy for them. What a beautiful thing to find. However, I tend to notice that those are the friends that often get jealous of my other friendships or the plans I make with others. I hope that I make it clear how much they mean to me because that is all I can do. I don’t have a live-in best friend. I don’t spend all of my hours or all of my days with my partner. I have different people in my life for different reasons. I love them all. I think my biggest insecurity/worry is that feeling that I’m sometimes expected to put my life, needs or other friendships on hold while those with “partner bffs” hang out with their bffs. Not everyone can understand, so I have to teach myself to let go of the guilt. Truthfully though I just reaaaaallly wish my friends with bff partners could understand so they’d stop getting jealous. They want me to be and still call me their best friend but they already have one. We were “best friends” till they found their partners and I harbor zero resentment for that, all I want is happiness for all of us. Sure you can have more than one best friend, but I simply don’t take their priority anymore. But so I have to move on, ya know? I keep in touch and try to maintain our friendship but when I get closer to a different friend it angers them in a way. If I make plans for a trip with a different friend I am ridden with guilt. Do I just tell myself to get over it? I’m doing my best? I know there’s nothing but love on my part. So it’s not truly my problem, right?

"My Boyfriend Talks Daily About Suicide -- Won't Go To Hospital Hi guys, I'm really just at a loss for what to do. I am absolutely gutted. My boyfriend has pretty serious depression and is in dire need of help. I won't be able to get him in to see a therapist until next week. He has recently become quite down on his luck and he hates himself for it. His anxiety stopped him from going to work, and he was fired. He has a new job now, but he hates it as it is a factory job where he works 60 hrs/week. Any time I try to help him find a new job so he can leave this job, he completely panics and shuts down and I can't say anything or else he yells. It has gotten so bad recently that I dread waking up in the morning because of the psychological warfare with him. He will do things like saying he wants to self-harm, or he is going to jump out of the car while I am driving. I have been with him for years, through thick and thin. I have had to bring him to the hospital before, and he did get better for a few months. He told me tonight he doesn't want me to pick him up from work, and that he wasn't going to come home. At this point I feel completely lost, and I know calling the police won't help. I feel trapped and I need to get out for my own health, but I am deathly terrified he is going to kill himself if I leave. He told me I am the only thing holding him back from killing himself. I'm scared. He is such a good person when he isn't feeling this constant depression. I don't know how to get him to understand we just want to help him. He shuts me down every single day, and it hurts knowing he has given up on himself. What can I do to help him until he can see his therapist next week?

"I've had no energy to do anything the last couple of days and I'm really struggling to get out of this funk I've had problems with depression for years so none of this is new to me, but I'm having a really rough couple of days and think I'd like to just talk with someone. Today is the second day I'm missing classes. My first one starts in an hour and I live too far away to get there in time at this point. I couldn't get out of bed, and had the same problem yesterday. I just get this feeling of dread when I think about getting ready and actually leaving, and all I feel like I can do is lie in bed thinking about different ways I could kill myself (I'm not going to, it's just something I seem to always end up thinking about in bed, I know it's toxic but it's comforting). I really can't miss any more classes after today, this semester is really important for my grades. I feel like such a piece of shit for missing them two days in a row, this is the exact sort of thing that fucked up my grades last term. Idk it'd be nice to talk to someone, about anything even. I only have one friend who knows I have problems with depression but I don't want her to deal with my emotional baggage.",Does the poster suffer from depression?,yes

"Have you ever cried for missing your childhood so bad? Well I often do, quite sometimes frankly. I just miss those good old days, when life was just so beautiful and easy. Nothing to worry about, nothing to cry for other than silly childish little things. My childhood was so beautiful. It was in France. It's been now a whole decade since I left France - the country I've always admired and will always do. I remember going to school, having so many friends, I felt like I'm the happiest child on Earth. Then suddenly one day, everything changed. The passing of time took away from me my childhood, my friends, my beloved France. Life suddenly just changed like that. No more joy, no more innocence, no more real friends, no more homeland. No more beautiful sunny days, only darkness, depression, nostalgia and tears. I'm trying to survive day by day through this hell on Earth. Each time those memories of my childhood flashbacks, I can't help stopping the tears that drop from my eyes. Whenever someone mentions France, I get overwhelmed. I'm living the hardest time of my life. A 10-year ""war in lifetime"", as I call it, still going on, and doesn't seem to have an end soon. I know those good old times are just memories, obviously. Tomorrow when I wake up, things will be just the same. But my hope will never die. My redemption will come, soon or late. This moment of my life will also be just memories, just like those good old days of my childhood in France. I didn't go in detail 'cause I don't think many people will be interested in my story. But if you are, I wouldn't mind sharing you the whole story, as long as you can share me yours. And how about you? Have you ever cried for missing your childhood so bad?",Does the poster suffer from depression?,yes
"There truly is no hope. For any of us. This is the bleakest truth of all. Everything is more complicated than you think. You only see a tenth of what is true. There are a million little strings attached to every choice you make; you can destroy your life every time you choose. But maybe you won't know for twenty years. And you may never ever trace it to its source. And you only get one chance to play it out. Just try and figure out your own divorce. And they say there is no fate, but there is: it's what you create. And even though the world goes on for eons and eons, you are only here for a fraction of a fraction of a second. Most of your time is spent being dead or not yet born. But while alive, you wait in vain, wasting years, for a phone call or a letter or a look from someone or something to make it all right. And it never comes or it seems to but it doesn't really. And so you spend your time in vague regret or vaguer hope that something good will come along. Something to make you feel connected, something to make you feel whole, something to make you feel loved. And the truth is I feel so angry, and the truth is I feel so fucking sad, and the truth is I've felt so fucking hurt for so fucking long and for just as long I've been pretending I'm OK, just to get along, just for, I don't know why, maybe because no one wants to hear about my misery, because they have their own. Well, fuck everybody.",Does the poster suffer from depression?,yes
"Back to square 1 Depression sucks. I have Been depressed for longer than I could remember. Some days are okay, I could manage to get out of bed and go out. Some days I just want to shut myself in my bedroom, lying on my bed. And then I feel useless and ruminate over the fact that I am in fact useless. Today I feel like absolute shit because the weather sucks. No I am not going out of my home. I don't care if I am running out of food in my apt.

"I'm so tired. So tired of everything. I lost mostly everything I've cared about in such a short timeframe. My father went from cancer diagnosis to dead in a 3 month time span. My friends don't deserve to deal with me so I've isolated myself. They just enjoy shitposting and memeing, not a pathetic emo child who is literally incapable of being happy right now. One of my closest friends and unfortunately now ex-gf, not only do I still hate myself for how I was but I can't even bring myself to talk to her, I'm just a pathetic waste of a human. All notifications on everything have been off for nearly a week, I don't get on discord anymore. I just feel so alone, so helpless, so very tired both physically and mentally. Even something as simple as having to raid on WoW, my anxiety is horrible with dealing currently and I constantly stress out about people finding out that I'm unhappy because I don't want anyone to see me like this. It's pathetic. It's the only 'social' thing I do anymore and I don't even want to do that. Playing a videogame is too stressful. P a t h e t i c. There is no fixing me I've come to realize, I just accept what is going to happen to me since I know I don't deserve to be happy.

"Whenever I try to change my life these thoughts pop up Had depression and anxiety for years and have many times tried to make changes to my life. But I can't shake the thought that says: ""why bother?"". ""Why suffer through all that extra pain that change requires just for a long shot chance of a normal life?"". And on top of that I don't even know if I want a normal life! I Often think that the only thing that separates myself from the ""normal people"" (in lack of a better word,) is that the ""normal people"" have an easier time fooling themselves, a bigger capacity for self-delucions. And if happiness can only come from convincing yourself of existential lies, I'm not sure if that (happiness) is for me... Has anyone else struggled with these thoughts?

"What Depression is Like For Me. Having depression is like sailing with a hole inside your boat and only a bucket to keep you afloat. Depression is wanting to have friends but are too anxious to go out and stay a while longer. Depression is forcing yourself out of bed, not for yourself but those who count on you. Depression is having an empty feeling inside your chest while your head is crowded with self loathing. Depression is where people tell you ""it will all get better"" but only hearing the silent whispers of the wind. Depression is where you slowly lose your personality, joy, and interest for those things that you have used to love. Depression is where a stranger tells you ""I'll be here for you"" and you take it as an insult. Depression is where you hurt, crawl on the floor crying, grabbing on to dear life alone in your dark room with your thoughts, too tired to do anything and then go to bed only to rise again to pretend that nothing happened. To pretend, nothing happened.",Does the poster suffer from depression?,yes

"Housemate/friend won’t come out of her bedroom and is pregnant So my boyfriend and I moved in with our friend and her bf. We all had this idea of living together, hanging out, have dinner get togethers with our other friends &amp; board game nights etc.. it was all great and exciting but then at day 1 after the move, our friend and her bf just kept to themselves, in their room and hardly hangs out with us. Issues came up with them not helping out with the household chores and when my bf and I brought it up, they got defensive. Then our friend informed us that she is pregnant which changes the dynamics in the house even more as they now plan to get out of our shared lease early. That leaves us to figure out how to pay for the remaining months and look for a replacement. That’s fine, it’s their decision to have the baby. But then immediately after that announcement my friend just literally stopped talking to us, she won’t leave her room, and she would have her bf bring food to her room. In a rare occasion that she comes home while we’re in the living room , she doesn’t say hi or talk to us. I am really confused and hurt because I feel like I’ve lost a friend that I used to know.

"Torn. Need advice... Hey Reddit. I am not sure how to start all this but im going to explain to my best ability. Here goes. So, i have i had depression and anxiety give or take 3 years. I recently opened up about it to my girlfriend and she encouraged me to open up about it to my mother. I told her about almost everything. The one thing i did not mention to her was the... suicidal thoughts. Now, for our family “feelings” isnt our thing. We keep everything closed up and then repress it all. Thats what i have been doing for years not just with depression but everything. Now, these past three days have been brutal on me. I had no want to leave my bed or eat or even sleep. I just lay there and listen to music. I have been having suicial thoughts here and there these past three days. I will have happy moments here and there. But it doesnt last (shocker) and i just go back to feeling like pure awfulness. So, I am a 17 y/o male and I start senior year in August. We are a military family. My dream is the military. Thats all i have ever wanted. I want to follow my brothers footsteps because he is a total badass. All ive ever talked about to people, when they ask me what i want, to do is how badly i want to join the military. I do not think, with my current mental state, that i should go to the military. But i also fully believe that if i dont go i will disappoint everyone around me and they will be disgusted in me and i also believe that i will fall deeper into this dark hole i have been in. I have come to ask you guys, Any ideas on what to do? I am taking a cross country trip in 2 weeks with my brother and I will ask him some things about this and hopefully it will clear my head. Thank you for reading. I forgot to mention. I want to go get help. get put on medication. But the military doesnt accept people who are on anti depressants.

"Why is it that I forget information about certain people? Today, I've asked one of my female coworkers about what degree is she going for even though I keep asking that question when I forgot. She told me she's going for a dental bachelor. I've brought up that I've brought this up a bunch of times and she nodded. I felt pretty embarrassed for asking that question and forgetting the answer a lot of times. (She isn't the only one though) I think the reason why I forget is because the front end has a tendency to have its employees to have erratic working schedules thus it doesn't help when some of the employees go to college on their days off. I'm twenty five year old woman who doesn't go to college because I'm not too wild about school. I know a little bit about some of my coworkers, but I don't hang out with them outside the workplace because of many reasons. 1.) I don't always to make the effort to build a relationship with them because I don't have a lot to say except for questions such how's your day, what time are you working til, and anything new. I will speak when I'm spoken to. 2.) I'm usually inside my head thinking a lot. 3.) I look for people with similar interests. (video games, animation, internet, vaporwave, and so forth on) 4.) I usually wait until someone talks to me. 5.) I don't open up to people easily. 6.) My social life is spent more online. 7.) The interests I have aren't mainstream (video games seem to be somewhat mainstream these days) 8.) I have autism while most of the employees don't have autism. 9.) I don't drive due to my fear of disability limiting my ability to drive safety. 10.) I don't talk a lot about my interests because I'm afraid I may obsess over them over and over again due to the point it may annoy co workers. 11.) I don't usually get involved with conversations with co workers because I need to focus on my job. 12.) When the time gets busy, I normally don't talk a lot. Again, I need focus on the job. 13.) I come from a solitary family from my mother's side. (introversion) 14.) I have a fear that I may say something that may offend them. 15.) I don't always have the motivation to socialize. 16.) I don't talk about my social life with family for reasons. 17.) I come across as serious, thus it doesn't help that I take a lot of things seriously I'm currently looking for free volunteer drivers in my area so I could get to places and make and keep friends. Thankfully, I have someone at home to take me to work, but not always available to take me. Thus I can get to work by walking. (My town is somewhat walk-able) Back to retaining some information about co workers, I remember them I like some of the facts about them. I will put the first letter of my names of the co workers for privacy. Example: B is big on cats, she has an eighteen year old daughter who used to have a pet bunny long time ago. She also love chinese as much as I do. C loves to play video games just like I do. He doesn't like the customer is always right policy. I have a fifteen minute break for every five hours I work. The breakroom tends to vary with there's no people to there's lots of people. Some of the co workers I know use their phone to browse on the internet while eating, and I don't want to bother them while they browse on their phone. Let's face it, it's getting tougher to socialize in real life when internet's taking over everyday life. TL;DR I'd like to know why I lose track of facts of particular co workers and what could I do about it.",Does the poster suffer from depression?,no

"Leapfrogger/Friend Stealer/Friend Poacher etc. Just for some context in my form group (like a morning register class or a house class as some call it) I sat at a table with people I didn't really talk to, but since I couldn't change seats I decided to make some friends with people at the table. In grade/year 8 or 9 I met two guys who are now great friends of mine, one I talk to more than the other since he stayed at home instead of at school due to health issues. Fast forward a few months and you have the situation above. So I started talking about a common interest with this guy we shall name Manny, now Manny and I only talked in form, and after I would go back to my main social circle with my best mate. After a while (about grade 9-10 maybe) I decided Manny should go and chat with me and my best mate's social circle for once, so introduced them both to each other, and they got on well. Now between year 10-11 I definitely noticed that Manny started taking more of my best mates interest, which makes sense and happens often so I didn't think of it. It only caught my attention when my best mate stopped inviting me to events such as hangouts at the park and going on cinema trips with my other friend who stays at home. Instead he would invite Manny and Manny would invite him and some of my other friends to many events like the cinema and sleepovers and whatnot. Over time I would be completely excluded from my friends activities and everytime invited them to do something, they would say ""im not sure if i can go"" only for me to find out they went with Manny somewhere. Sure we are all still friends but I feel like i'm being slowly excluded. Is this just me? What do you all think?",Does the poster suffer from depression?,no

"They told me that all they can do is replace my hard drive, but they can't recover my 10 years of bitter-sweet memories. So I bought an external hard drive, thinking that everything would be safe on it, right? If I'm gonna spend $50 on something, it should at least be good at something, right? So I exported every thing from the past 10 years onto it. Recently, my computer can't even read the hard drive anymore. I went to the customer help service and they said that they can't do anything to access my data and all they can do is replace it (within warranty). All my graduation photos, friend hang outs, and all just precious moments, will have to go. I've always been looked down upon. I was never up to standard to anyone.

"What’s the point of coming up if you’re gonna go down? I moved to a new city with the love of my life after 5 years of loving him. I was ready to propose, I looked at rings, I called jewelers. I debated getting a ring of meteorite, you know? He’s super nerdy, super cute. Science geek and all. I’d like to think every guy buying rings thinks about the meteorite ring haha. Then he tells me that he feels like a she. I loved her no matter what. I told her I still loved her and that she’s going to be one of the most beautiful girls ever. I still planned to propose. I loved her more that she’s her true self. Then my heart gets broken. She tells me that she can’t see a future with me together. She tells me that she’s only interested in women. There wasn’t much for me to do but respect her true feelings. I couldn’t force her to love me. For a few weeks I lost my best-friend and my future. We still lived together, music helped, weed helped. I made friends. I tried to be happy, and for a little I think I really was okay. But it was so stormy, one tip of the scale and I was back to being broken. Then I find out that she’s seeing other guys. My heart was gone, the only feeling is that feeling when your heart drops to your stomach. It’s a little harder to swallow, did life get harder? Did she make it easier? I don’t know. I wasn’t good enough for her. She says otherwise. I know she means the best for me with her heart but man, did it hurt the same. I ask her to give me time, as a roommate, as a past lover, give me time to heal before you see someone. Please, just give me some time to heal. But she couldn’t wait. I don’t blame her, she’s discovering herself. She’s beautiful. I never had a chance. There are better men for her. I’m broken, the pieces stomped on. I try. I go to work. I exercise. I eat healthy. I tell myself “improve for yourself and no one else”. It’s a lie. Life seems to drag on, I try to smile, I miss my best friend. I try to act like everything’s alright to her. She can’t be seeing me like this, it hurts her too. I meet a guy. He’s cute, a little simple, but cute. We start to hang out, workout together even. He takes me to some of the most beautiful places, I try to swallow my doubt and bring my heart back. Somedays, I could swallow just fine around him. When I was sure I was ready, I told him. It was too late. I took too long. I was just dead. I made plans, wrote good bye letters, planned that my little siblings would get what money I had left. I know it’s selfish, I know it can get better. I even tried to find a program that sends emails at a certain time so everyone could get a good nights sleep before they received my letter. I couldn’t do it. I stood on the edge of a bridge, the edge of a cliff, wore my favorite clothes. Listened to my favorite songs. Every time I couldn’t do it. You never think of it as someone being brave. But I was scared, I couldn’t imagine how anyone took that step off, pulled the trigger, kicked the chair. They had to be brave. And now, I’m back.

"Depression and grief I am a 28 yr old M, who has been diagnosed with treatment resistant MDD from the age of 16. Recently, I was attempting to get into a ketamine study in a NYC hospital and was asked a number of questions about my background. One item which came up that I have not thought about in a while was the specifics of my uncles suicide when I was around 13. My uncle was a 28 yr old gay M, developed HIV and killed himself. Though this is not what I was initially told. It took around 10 years with every year or so getting a new piece of information. Initially I was told he had cancer and died. Then I was told he had cancer and my grandparents ""pulled the plug"". Then I was told he was gay, had cancer, and my grandparents ""pulled the plug"". Then I was told he was gay, had HIV, and my grandparents ""pulled the plug"". Then, finally, I was told he was gay, had HIV and killed himself. I think I secretly had an understanding of how he had killed himself even when I was a kid and was not told due to subtle hints that kids will typically pick up on. Even if I did not, I always had the feeling that something was wrong and that my parents were not truthful. After discussing his death for two hours for the study, I realized that the depression I have been feeling for over 12 years is so similar to the feeling I get when I think of my uncle. Intense grief. I delved into the feeling more and have not been able to stop crying for the past few days about my uncle. Does this make sense from a psychological stand point to be greiving for this long? I know there is no time limit on emotions but does it make sense for my depression to be as a result of shoving down his death and holding onto it for all this time? I would love to hear some thoughts and opinions. I dont know exactly what I am looking for by posting this but I have really been struggling with the emotions I have been having and would appreciate some guidance and if not, some affirmation.",Does the poster suffer from depression?,yes

"School failure I think I'm doing something wrong. I found myself in a situation where I was lucky to move to prosperous country. Except I'm 27 with no degree, no proper work experience, just some odd jobs. I'm an embarrassment compared to other immigrants. Last year I began studying for the first time since high school , just to realize the field does not interest me. I barely even understand the language. My GPA is horrible. And I can't change schools for at least another 2 years due to family. I can't even get a job because my town has almost none, and the ones it does have are given to the natives (I'm foreign).

"My bio dad died and his family didnt tell me until 3 days later... Him and I were never very close. Probably an understatement considering our only interactions were him calling drunk and calling me dirty names since the age of 14.

He was intubated and couldn't speak for most of his hospital stay. He was 39. I asked his side of the family why nobody told me he was in the hospital or why nobody told me died the day it happened. Their reasoning? I had vented at a few points saying I wished he was dead (normally after he would call me drunk and call me a whore and talk shit on my mother who raised me since birth). I am also not invited to the service. Should I feel duped? Should I feel cheated out of a chance to say goodbye even though we weren't on the best of terms? Because his family and girlfriend sure as hell made it clear i don't even deserve to grieve. All i wanted was a relationship with him and all I got was name calling and him taking me and my mom told court over the $200 he had to pay in child support each month. I wasn't very nice to him, I tried to be.. But he made it so hard. So was it really they're call to say I couldn't see him. Or am I right to feel this way..",Does the poster suffer from depression?,yes
"Roomie read a text I sent about her on another friends phone So I'm gonna delete this right after but I kinda fucked up bad... I'm a 24 yo female btw living in an apartment w 4 other ppl. Ok so I came home from a stressful night and one of my roommates was drunk af, I left to go see a friend for a bit and when I returned there was a pot of mac and cheese sitting on the stove with the burner on high and no one was around... turns out drunk roomie started cooking then abandoned it there. What annoyed me more was that it was my mac and cheese she cooked and burnt. I understand we get drunk and we take our roomies food... it happens ok, I've done it (rarely) but yeah it happens. I was mainly annoyed that the stove was on high and left unattended while she went out partying! If I wouldn't have come home it could have started a fire. SO me being the idiot I am, I sent a text to our other roomie just explaining that I was a bit annoyed that our other roomie left the stove on and was also using my food wo asking. It wasn't shit talking in my opinion, as the text legit said.. ""I just came home and _____ left the stove on and burnt food and left it there and it was also my food so I'm a bit annoyed"" Me and said roomie had been talking earlier about how we were a bit annoyed she came home so drunk and loud. I legit just said I was a bit annoyed bc she left the stove on and used my food. But I wasn't like incredibly mad I was just venting bc I know I'd get over it in an hour and just tell her tomorrow not to leave food unattended or ask if she'd like to take some of my food.... SO here's where im dumb.... my other roomie left her phone in the kitchen and the message must have popped up or the other girl was snooping through her phone and saw it.... she then proceeded to text me bitching me out and sending awful passive aggressive texts. I remained calm and mature and just explained that yes I was a bit annoyed, but I didn't send the text to be malicious or shit talk, and that I wasn't mad at her. She turned it all around on me and now I'm left feeling like the mean person. The only person I normally vent to about friends is my sister and no one else.. I don't like ""shit talking"" but everyone gets annoyed and needs to vent from time to time. It's healthy to get it off your chest and I didn't mean for her to see it... also it wasn't a mean text or anything....and also she was the one to disrespect me so I feel I had a right to be annoyed, though I shouldn't have sent that text but it could be a lot worse ... WHAT DO I DO NOW. She's so mad and ignoring me. Ugh.",Does the poster suffer from depression?,no

"I'm getting annoyed constantly by one of my closest friends We've been friends since 8th grade, and she's a great friend, outgoing, funny, smart, the usual. We're pretty close, not absolute besties, but at the level where we can share memes with each other at 3am and not think it weird. But this year she's the only one of my friends from last year that has the same lunch as me, so I sit with her everyday. The problem is her bestest friend in the whole world also has the same lunch, so I'm always the awkward third wheel. I always try to help her when she needs it because a, she's my friend, and b, she doesn't have an easy home life. She never has enough to eat at lunch so I always bring something extra, and she also always needs rides everywhere. She says it's because her guardian is at work, or is visiting other family, is babysitting, but I think her family just doesn't want to give her rides places. I don't mind most of the time, but it's gotten to the point where she almost assumes we'll give her a ride when she needs it, and we can't always do that. She also stopped coming to lunch last week to go practice in the orchestra room, and I never even see her until orchestra class. I know something's not right, but every attempt to figure it out has gone unrewarded. I've made new friends this year through cross country and orchestra, and they have the same lunch I do. I went and sat with them one day, but my other friend looked almost mad when I told her I was sitting with them just for that day. It's okay for you to ignore me most of lunch and then not even show up and not answering me when I ask where you've been, but I can't make new friends and sit with them every now and then? I'm just not sure where to go from here, because I don't want to stop being friends, I really don't, but I just feel like my new friends can be better friends, and friends I can relate to better. I just don't want to do or say something I'll regret, especially because I know her life at home isn't great and she needs friends, but she shouldn't be pushing her problems onto me either",Does the poster suffer from depression?,no
"Can anyone cheer me up? Apparently, my dad used to work in another country. While he was away, my mom allegedly cheated on him several times. The only source of mine is my cousin, who gets the info from my sister. So I guess it is true. And to think about it, she did wear a lot of makeup back then. Not the normal amount I mean. To keep it short, when this hit me, I could not imagine her cheating on my dad. I’ve also heard that they are not divorcing because of me, which is plain stupid.

"Everything has changed... About four years ago I was the typical loner. I was in the middle school. Nobody took me seriously, because my hobbies were not shared by anyone else. I'm from a small town, so it was difficult for me to find someone who actually liked the things I did. At the time I liked things like anime, video games and MLP. I am a 19 year old lass now and I only like video games now. In the final grade of my middle school I met a girl. She was about two years younger but liked the same things I did. I was so happy to finally meet someone like me. We have bonded a lot and she was the first person I truly loved, except for my family, of course. About two years ago we started to get distant. She kept talking to me about things I was uncomfortable with, but whenever I tried to talk about something that bothered me, she told me she was busy and didn't hear me out. It escalated in June of 2016. I started talking to her friends, because they seemed like such wonderful people to me. Then we met up, all of us. She kept crying and making scenes. Few weeks before that, she accused me of liking HER friends more than I liked her. But when we all met, it seemed alright, save for her crying etc... When I got home the next day, she told me off. Really badly. She told me to go to hell, called me all sorts of names and I feared... I feared I would never be able to find someone like her again. I tried to end it. Swallowed sleeping pills and drank alcohol. I woke up the next day in a hospital. I woke up to a text from her. One that said she wishes my mother was torn apart by the girl's dogs... It's been two years. I've gotten better, met friends that helped me out a lot and I will probably never be able to repay it. But this past of mine, it still haunts me. I don't think I'll ever be able to trust someone like this again. I have gotten so cynical and careless about everything... It still hurts.",Does the poster suffer from depression?,yes

"Finally got a job, but don't really care. So, finally after about 10-11 months, I got a job. The job isn't a bad one. Quite the opposite, actually. They specifically hired me saying that they weren't looking for someone to just stick for a year and move on; they wanted to hire someone and essentially keep them/train them eventually up to management level in the course of hopefully a year or two depending how well I take it. I said yes... though, mostly out of seizing a good opportunity. I'm not happy, or excited. I just don't care, really. &amp;nbsp; First and foremost, I'm a minimalist. The urgency of ""I need to save and buy a house"", or ""I need a secure career/future"", etc.. is non-existent in my life. Everything I own could fit in a van, and there would still be space left. I'm not exaggerating. I've even contemplated living in one; build some insulation to the walls, lay out some flooring, and call it home. I'd be absolutely 100% comfortable. Anyway~ My point is I actually have no reason to be taking this opportunity. The only thing that really ran through my head was ""I'll probably kick myself in the ass in the future for not taking this"". Considering this is a job that'll eventually lead to a solid annual salary within essentially no time, and requires no degrees or fancy stuff, it was kinda hard to say no. But it was also kinda hard to say yes. I don't have an endgame. I don't have a goal. At best, the closest thing to a goal that came to mind was ""Eh, I'd probably get back into riding, and buy myself a motorcycle or something"". That was it. My mind literally blanks after that. Nothing else is there. &amp;nbsp; I'm not suicidal. I don't go to sleep hoping that I'll never wake up again (though I wouldn't be upset by it), and I don't wake up upset that I'm alive for another day in life. If I had to describe how I feel right now... Everything is in a very, very quiet limbo. It's a very passive depression. &amp;nbsp; The best way I can summarize it is that this world has so much ""noise"", and it's exhausting for me. I get exhausted just from thinking about it. I wish people could just relax, and stop stirring so much motion around. It's always been like this for my entire life. I'm so tired. Everything/everyone has to move around with such haste, but all I want to do is stop. I just want to appreciate the colors. I want to laugh. I want to be happy. But in this world, you *can't* be happy looking at the colors. &amp;nbsp; *You just.. can't.*",Does the poster suffer from depression?,yes
"My father may have been a monster after all... I’ll try to make this as short as I can I am a 32/F both my parents have passed my mom as recently as 12/2016. My father was up in age when I was born. My mom was wife number 5 and much younger. So when he passed in 2013 it was sad but he lived till his nineties. My parents each had two kids from previous marriages that are much older then me. My mom got sick and then was dying for a year. I was her caregiver 100% and she lived with me. I worked two jobs had no days off and was a P/T nanny as well. Which made her so happy to have in the house cause she loved babies. My bro and sister are human garbage. They did nothing for her when she was dying, made life horrible for me, disliked my care for her just all around horrible people who pushed me to the brink of suicide. I cut all ties when she died moved to another part of the state and got a promotion. I’m doing alright now and it’s only been a little over a year. So now I had a brother from my dads marriage but he died in a car wreck in 07. My sister from my dads side is all the family I have left. I love her dearly but she has mental issues that are severe. Depression, schizophrenia, anxiety. We live in different states and I tried to get her to move to my state and she Wont she likes where she is. She lives independently and goes to a day program so she manages ok. Recently she has been upset at my cutting ties with my half siblings her step siblings. I told her I would have no problem with her continuing contact but I would not. Hell my cunt of a shitty sister tried to borrow money from her the majority of the times she called her but still I can’t stop her she is a 50yr old woman. But now my fragile sister is starting to not do well she is recalling abuse from when she was a teen. Gang rape at 13 multiple rapes in high school etc. and she said our dad did nothing and noticed nothing Now I know this could be her illness at play but....I think I believe her. She got sick or I should say her schizophrenia came to the front lines in her early 20s after she graduated college and had a pretty damn good job. I wasn’t even born yet but my mom was in the picture. (My mom and her were very close) When my sister had her breakdown she described horrible rape and abuse in the middle of delusions and episodes. My mom said my dad thought it was her sickness but as my mom put it the way she described it happening it originated somewhere. Whether delusions morphed her memories my mom thought it happened to her. So now this sister only has me to vent to. I tried to call her case manager but as she is an adult and hasn’t been hospitalized in decades she won’t let me speak to her. I’m going to call her day program and try to speak to someone about her seeing a rape counselor or something along wit her regular treatment. In a way I don’t want to deal with something this heavy again and I know that’s selfish I lost years of myself helping care for my dying father then 100% for my mom I was pushed to the brink of my own sanity And then there is the fact that I think my father did do nothing. I was his favorite and I know I was. He never hit me and my mom but he was verbally abusive. But he favorited me cause I am the most like him. He valued education and ambition and I think he felt my sister failed him being sick along with my brother. He acted as a father and I have good memories of him but he wasn’t exactly a emotional or loving person to my mom or at times me. But I guess I got the little he had in him. Now I’m starting to wonder if he was a sociopath or fuck a damn monster. After my brother who would be said sisters full brother died in what we thought was a regular car accident I found out it wasn’t. He was on pills and had an addiction and was telling people this shit will kill me. And from the police report witnesses state he just veered into a pole never hit anyone or anything. Just went into a tree. My fathers first two children ended up like they did and then there is is me. Without my mom would I have been something different? While I pulled myself out of the hole I thought I was in, I haven’t done well in dating or making friends in my new city. before my parents illnesses I was good at it. I’m afraid I’m doing ok with all these losses because I am like him. Through my job I’m booking sessions with a therapist but im still scared to pick up the phone when my sister calls I know I sound really selfish",Does the poster suffer from depression?,no

She asked me to call her at about 12am because she was afraid of the thunderstorm she heard and when we got on the phone she started flirting with me.

Dealing with a narcissistic mother Ok. I live at home after graduating from college with my mom because I'm in the process of planning my career and finding a job to move out eventually. The thing is its like being in hell when you have a mother with clear mental problems bullying you all the time. She constantly needs attention and if she doesn't get it she changes the locks or threatens me with an eviction notice or tries to remove all the food from the house knowing I don't have anywhere to go and I'm doing all I can as fast as I possibly can to move out. I don't eat much because even if I consume a dollar to 4 dollars worth of food a week she still says I'm eating her out of house and home. I work on my portfolio from sunrise to sunset daily so I'm in my room 90 percent of the time but she accuses me of being secretive because she can't know every little thing I do. She doesn't believe in boundaries and my mental health has suffered greatly because of it.

"My Father and Step-Mother sound like they will be getting a divorce. I have three half siblings whom I'm relatively close to, two of them are teenagers and still under their parents' care. Anyways long story short it's my father's consumption of alcohol that's causing the damage. He does well for awhile then doesn't and it's been going on like this for years. Unfortunately my father and I aren't that close. It almost feels like we're walking acquaintances inside the same home when we have dinner together as a family. He seems distant to everyone in our family as well, it can be hard for him to open up. I think my father is really depressed, but he refuses to see a therapist or anything like that. He may be going through some sort of (late) midlife crises right now. He still works his job and apparently brings home enough money to support his family. My step-mother took me aside and looked worried about her situation. She expressed that she may need to get legal help, and is concerned about protecting her children. At this point, I'm going to try and open up to my Dad and just point blank ask him what's going on with his life? He's about to lose his wife of 25+ years and hit a hard rock bottom. I hate to see him do this as he's been a pretty good Dad overall, and always provided for his family... at least keeping our heads above water financially. Any thoughts about how to approach alcohol use and possibly getting a stubborn old man to seek help? I know it's gotta be on his terms and everything, but I don't know what else to do.

"I lost my father to a sudden and completely unexpected heart attack two weeks ago. I've been up and down, but right now I'm at a loss. What are some strategies you'd employ(secular wise, i'm non religious). I suffer from severe anxiety(GAD) and severe depression. xpost /r/griefsupport I'm going to seek counselling by the way very soon. My Dad's service hasn't happened yet. I was planning after that to start up again but with this added part. So yeah, my dad showing no signs of it, had a massive heart attack on the 14th and passed away on the 16th at 73 years old. I realize people's times do come, and he had health problems(As far as we knew, no heart disease, had been checked out) but he didn't smoke or drink and he lost a lot of weight and took care of himself for the most part. He was slowing down, but no more then an older person would. To say it was a shock would be putting it mildly. I ugly cried in front of him and his hospital bed several times. I'm just so broken up for my mom and my family. Of course, me too. But my Mom and Dad were married for 45 years. And although it wasn't perfect, they had a true love. And I have such a close relationship with my mother. So when her heart is breaking it's hard for me to see. I sponge it. I feel that pain. I've also unfortunately had to deal with siblings who are dealing with this tragedy by lashing out and trying to put themselves ahead of myself and my brother. (My sister and other brother). And that's been super difficult. They've said some ugly things that I'm trying to look past at the current moment. Anyways, I just wanted to know other then counselling, if there's anything you feel that might be of use to me and my brain to move forward without Dad.

"My dad is about to be 65. I'm scared suddenly at the age, and I'm sad because the last few years I wasted and didn't see him enough. He's a very healthy, smart person. Do I still have quality years for us to do activities together? Wondering if anyone can tell me it's all going to be okay in the sense that 65 is not that old, and that I still have time to make memories and learn from my dad at his age. I'm 26. The concept of him having nothing new to teach me and needing me to take care of him now is truly devastating, because it's hitting me how much time has gone by, and just the idea of me being more capable than my father is a bit scary. He's healthy, smart, independent, wise. He still seems the same as he always did except for being a bit more gray, and you can see the age in his face a bit clearer. He drives himself around, works, volunteers, has a long distance relationship. He just seems to be a bit upset and nervous about the state of my life. Like I'm always complaining and yammering about something and it's hard on him. Yet all he wants to do is help me, so he keeps trying, and every time, he just gets put through the ringer and it's hard on him. I feel so bad because I say very harsh things and he's such a fragile person, trying so hard to be tough in this world. And I know shocking the system when you're old is hard on you. So I'm trying to just be mature, put all of the mess behind me, and ensure evevery time him and I are together now, he can see that I'm all good, grown up, and not going to make everything bad for him again. I just want 65 onwards for him and us to be quality bonding time.",Does the poster suffer from depression?,yes
"Alienating family Do you ever get tired of saying you're okay when you're not but you don't want to talk about it? So instead you just stop talking to them but then you feel worse for alienating your family and they have no idea why or what's going on with you. My family has never been super close. We get along with each other and talk to each other but we're not a support system and I don't feel comfortable talking to them about my problems. I feel like I'll be judged and gossiped about so I just keep it to myself and as a result wind up pushing them all away. The only person in this world I feel I can talk to about my problems are my husband and I know that's a huge burden on him to be my only outlet, my only friend. It's putting a strain on our relationship and I blame myself for this. It's a lot of pressure to put on someone. Living with a person with depression is hard enough under normal circumstances (whatever normal is) but add the burden of being the only friend, the only person that knows, the only person period.

I've been trying to block him but he keeps making more accounts telling me to kill myself and that noone cares bout me. he has told me to shoot myself in the head with a gun, drink battery acid and tells me that my friends on PlayStation are no life's for supporting and putting up with me.

"Help: ruining my University course Second year student here in a UK university. I hardly tried at all in the first year, got generally bad grades on my coursework, but revised just enough for the exams to get a 2:1, which is second from the best grade. I also had a few weeks of socialising separated by many weeks of pretty much self-imposed (and lack of sleep imposed) loneliness. So at the time I felt terrible, but looking back on it from second year I had some good memories. Now I'm missing half the lectures, sometimes I don't even go to the shops to get food for the day and have a terrible diet, miss enormous amounts of sleep, and haven't done any work at all. I'm already failing, and even with resits I have to get a ridiculous mark on my tests this semester to even stand a chance of a worthy final score after the 3rd year is over. I feel like the only thing that's gonna bring me out of the depression is the pride of getting a good grade, but I'm way too pessimistic right now to believe that deep down I can even do it. I'm convinced that only 2 friends like me, 1 pities me, and their friends just mock me stealthily. Paid for societies but don't go to any.

"How to cope with disrespectful and lying friend? HI I'm new to reddit so please bear with me So this is the situation: My friend and I often interact while playing online games as we're both huge nerds and gamers. I really enjoy spending time with her. However she has this other friend that I really dislike and I would rather play alone than put up with interacting with her friend. I have on multiple occasions expressed my discomfort with her friend and she has acknowledged it but would still invite him anyways without asking me. When that happens I usually just say sorry I don't feel like playing. Sorry for being difficult. She knows her friend will repel me. So anyways after sometime I asked if I can request not to invite him when I'm playing with her and would understand if she said no cause I realize it's a selfish request. She said it's ok no problem. So then we proceed to our routine and there's no issue whatsoever. I told her if it's too difficult to say no or your friend keeps bugging you about it I can go as I didn't want to make it difficult with my own selfishness. The problem a rise when she invited a mystery friend with different name. I suspected and knew that it was her friend that I disliked so immediately asked who that was and she said it's just a random. Not happy with her lying I went off to calm down and confronted her about it, trying to be as clear and straight to the point as I can. I expressed that what she did was hurtful and disrespectful in my point of view. I told her I'm not pleased at the fact she lied even when I called her out. So I said it's on her to resolve this issue. She replied saying there is no issue and what she did was fine. Saying it wasn't disrespectful and its not a big lie plus it was to see if I would even notice its her friend. Long story short she said if it was her she wouldn't be angry cause she's a grown up and that I'm being immature and childish by blowing things out of proportion over such joke-trivial matter. So this is more or less the situation and at the moment it's not good. As she thinks I'm in the wrong and she's right. I have considered the fact that I am wrong and have asked for an outside opinion but all my friends are just angry at how she's treating me. I understand that she can be friends with and spend time with whoever she wants. It's her life afterall. I'm not making her choose cause I know it's selfish and wrong so I'm choosing to remove myself in that situation as it's the only thing to do besides putting up with her friend. My problem is the fact that she attempted to trick me to play together with her friend and continue lying about it upon confrontation. Also by doing so I feel disrespected as she completely disregarded my feelings and opinion in the matter. I would have been perfectly fine if she told me at the start her friend wants to play and she can't really say no or she wants to play with him etc etc. In that case I'll just make myself scarce which I have no issue on doing. Instead she resorted to being deceitful with something so simple and dumb. There's quite a lot more so I'll probably update this but this is in essence more of less the situation.",Does the poster suffer from depression?,no
"Uneasy family members I have had a rough and lonely childhood, in fact i do not want to remember my childhood. There used to be daily fights in the house between my mom and dad. My mom used to talk rudely then and talks rudely even now. She behaves differently outside the house and is a complete different person inside the house, behaves as though we are a burden for her.

"I need to get my life on track Im 23 year old black man who just graduated from one of the best universities in the US. I've been depressed as fuck for a large portion of the last 4-6 years. I have no money, no girlfriend(or prospects), and no social life to speak of. I had a solid social life in college but had no luck with girls. Made a lot of friends but none that I'd consider great ones. I'm afraid of public expression, if I come out of this shell I'll just be that little underdeveloped, short loser who thinks he's the shit when he's accomplished nothing in life.

Do they think I'm gay? Do they think my voice is deep enough? Do they think I'm laid back? Do they think I'm fake? Do they think I'm a pussy? Do they think I get girls? Do they think my dick is small? Do they think I'm dressed well? Do they think I'm shy? Do they think I'm lame for a black guy? Do they think I act too white? Do they notice the awkwardness when I talk? Do they think I speak well? Do they think I ask too many questions? This causes me to lie to the people around me, including my family about little things that it's unnecessary to lie about. To put on this front of fake confidence when inside I feel like I'm not worth shit. I blow off my friends and then justify it to myself that I'm somehow too good for them. I don't pick up phone calls from family members and try to keep to myself. I just do nothing all day and wait for shit to come to me. I'm not the guy that gets girls, when it comes to trying to actually start a relationship with a girl my awkwardness and lameness just begins to show itself and she immediately senses it and can tell I'm not shit. I've had sex with 2 girls in my life and couldn't actually bust a nut for whatever reason. I'm an asshole to the people around me that do really nice things for me but somehow my brain keeps justifying my behavior and I keep doing it. I can't bring myself to do anything that is remotely productive or will help me better my life. I'm self aware to the point where I know I'm being a complete piece of shit but I can't find the motivation to turn it around. It's like my brain telling me I'll be content just living in my parents house until I'm fucking 60 years old. Somehow when I look in the mirror I see myself as an attractive man, I just look super young for 23, people say I look as young as 16 so I'm also self conscious about that which also makes me put on this facade when I'm around people. Recently for long stretches of months I just go completely ghost and don't leave the house or do anything of use. On the bright side I've had many positive experiences in life where I've felt my potential as a person start to become realized. I have a degree in communication studies from a top 15 university in the US. I have a family that loves and supports me (but probably wants me to move out just as much as I want to move out).

"Should I reach out to her or leave it alone? (TL;DR) I had a friend and it ended pretty bad IMO. I’ve really missed her over the past couple years and I thought about re-befriending her but I’m not sure. I’ll start with the good things about our past friendship: -she was pretty sweet to me. Very supportive of most things. -She stood up for me when like half the school picked on me for having a 2 foot bright orange Mohawk. -She tried to keep me from dating a pretty Toxic boy (but at the time I was young and wouldn’t listen) -She made me walk around the entire town with her frequently (helped me lose the weight I’d gained and build some muscle in my legs) -She was for the most part a great friend Now the bad: -since I didn’t listen about Toxic boy, we ended up dating for about 4 years. He’s said he didn’t like her cause when they went to school together she flirted with him and when he kissed her in the hallway she told the school he sexually assaulted her and got him sent to juvie. Now while I’m not gonna go into the semantics of whether or not it was s. Assault in anyway, I will say she fully apologized to him and me for it a while back but he made me tell her that we didn’t accept her apology and to “fuck off” -She borrowed a couple box sets of shows from me around this time, those sets were given to me by favorite aunt when I was young. When I wanted them back she claimed she couldn’t find them. Almost a year went by of her “looking” for them, and I told her (mostly from Toxic boy pushing me to) if she didn’t find them by the end of the week I was going to call the police and report her for stealing them. She gave them back to me a couple days later (scratched, though I don’t know if she knew they were scratched) -I also shortly dated, and quickly broke up with one of her brothers last year (our personalities didn’t really mix well) but I don’t think she holds it against me The manority of us breaking up was due to Toxic Boy (he’s he was toxic, he tried to fuck literally any girl friend I introduced him to) pushing me into breaking up with her, telling me she was the toxic one cause she didn’t support our relationship and cause of the juvie thing from years before. In 2015 she reached out to me on Facebook saying: “Hey i know your probably the last person you wanna hear from but, i just wanted to say im sorry for all the bullshit that happened when i was still in school. If you don't wanna be friends thats understandable, just know thats not me anymore, and im sorry” Which, of course, Toxic boy made me to reply incredibly rudely to and our friend ship just kind of died.

So I'm asking if their are any fathers who have ""red-pilled"" their children about women and what the best process of introducing red-pill philosophy and sexual strategies to my beta ""son"" I am thinking he's the right age as now he is beginning to notice girls, I bought him some nudie mags and I know he's been checking them out if you know what I mean, so I definitely think the time is right to give him the red-pill!

"Is it okay to be tired of pretending everything is okay to spark optimism? So I have alot going on in my life -- too much for me to want to spend five hours writing about it for this post. What's bothering me is that lately, things have been weighing down HARD. My patience is paper thin from years of abuse and I feel like in these last few months, I'm receding into myself because I don't have patience for even reasonable flaws in other people. I'm tired of being stepped on and dealing with the hand I've been dealt in life (I am CLAWING my way out of poverty ALONE, caused by a narcissistic parent kicking me out and attempting to kill me at 17 -- just made 21). I finally told my boyfriend today, not mincing any words, that I'm so fucking tired of being optimistic. That I'm tired of pretending anything is going to be fine because alot of the times I feel like it won't. ""Faking it till you make it"" has worked for me in the past, definitely, but being optimistic to KEEP myself from being depressing/depressed is not fucking working for me. It's idiotic. It's not that I think things are 100% pointless -- I'm working on a set of skills right now to get myself out of my minimum wage job to get a much better one. &amp;nbsp; But I'm just exhausted from trying to not worry other people and not expressing how fucking done I am with everything. Is this normal? Is this healthy? Like I said, not giving up. I'm working forward. I just feel like the fake optimism is an extra step and a formality at this point and honestly complaining today made me feel better, not going to lie, as I do my best to not do that because I feel like I'm ""pushing myself on others"" (my situation is so bleak that people almost never know what to say in response anyway because there is nothing close to an immediate solution). But I feel angry and spiteful that people who have been given everything or that can recieve assistance from family telling me how I have to ""perk up"" because It's ""what they do when things are hard"" when their ""hard"" is ""I stayed up all the time in college to study and it's hard"" vs ""I stay up all the time to study my new skillset AND risk my life every day on a chinese scooter that gives out at times to do deliveries in all of the elements to make a wage that isn't even livable, having one or more panic attacks a day because of dangerous drivers"". &amp;nbsp; I also feel bad because my SO is always trying to be an optimist. He's somehow perfected this even being depressed himself. Sometimes that bleeds through but he's usually hyper optimistic and it's exhausting. We've gotten in arguments in the past when he was less acquainted with my depression because if I wasn't immediately cheered up by him making jokes while I'm crying to make me laugh (let me work through my emotions, damn... It works sometimes but not ALL the time, seriously), he'd get insulted and take it personally that a single joke was not enough to change my outlook on life and fix all my issues. I feel kind of like I got a little snippy with him when I complained earlier and kept cutting him off and telling him how hopeless I felt and telling him, emotionlessly, ""I just don't care to be optimistic. I don't give a fuck. What's that going to do? I'm already tired, it's just going to make me more tired"" because I had a feeling that that was where he was going to go with it. I feel bad because he's just trying to help. But I am so fucking tired. So tired. I have a hard time doing anything if I don't think it has a point (Even if I hate a job, I'm still getting paid, and there is therefore a point to it) and I just didn't see the point of doing all this. I think I do to make him happy and worry less about me. But I'm so upset that I don't have the capacity right now to do more things to emotionally keep him comfortable. That's stupid.

We found out that we went to the same school as each other, but she is a couple of years younger than me so we never really met before until summer. So we started hanging out after class, and a few times on the weekends. She has always had some what of a communication problem and depression problem. However before i knew that there was a tjme where i messaged her and she hadn't responded and a couple of weeks had gone by. I was thinking that I was annoying her. So i told her we shouldn't bftiends anymore. Later finding out that she had communication issues. She literally has like no friends at all which i genuinely believe. Eventually we see each other in public, afterwards i message her and apologize, and wanting to befriends again. She eventually accepts my apology and we're somewhat on good terms. We eventaully hang out in person again and she is talking to me about how her boyfriend never talks to her and that her dad is being mean to her. So i give her the advice that idk her boyfriend but he could possibly be cheating on you if stops communicating as much woth you. But, again stressing idk know him so take what i said with a grain of salt. Weeks go by and she evetnually tells me that our friendshup isn't going to work out, and that nothing good has really came of it. And i should just stkp trying to be friends. This really hurt me i care about her a great deal. She then proceeds to unfriend me on facebook, and snapchat, and tells me to not contact her anymore. I need some helps guys, i feel like i should give het somr space and time to cool down and then i should message her apologizing for everything and that i want to be friends again.

"10 years I've been managing depression and I was doing well, until last Monday. Quick back story: 38/m/Ireland. I was a competitive Powerlifter and represented my country on 2 occasions with great success. My life was lifting; setting goals, reaching targets, smashing PBs...all helped with creating a future for myself. I started to feel unwell around December 2016 and developed a persistent, non-productive cough. Series of tests led me to an echocardiograph where it was discovered I was suffering Heart Failure. Dilated Cardio Myopathy caused by a viral infection, left my hearts function at 20%EF. Apparently I had a few months to live if I hadn't caught it. Ironically, now, I wish they hadn't discovered it. My world flipped upside down. No Powerlifting, no excessive exercise, restricted fluid intake, no over exertion, meds for the rest of my life, regular reviews in my heart clinic, multiple ambulance emergency rides to A&amp;E when my heart goes irregular. Hospital, pharmacy, hospital, pharmacy... Seems to be my life for the past year. Last Monday I snapped. It hit me. Everything I lost came crashing in on me. I got in my car, picked a place I knew well to ram my car into at 120mph. I was screaming at myself to do it. My left hand steering towards the end, my right hand steering me to survive. An image of my dog in my mind kept me on the road. I knew she'd miss me too much. I'm still very low now despite all my meds. I still wish I had gone through with it. I still think of going to the Cliffs of Moher and jumping... What a beautiful place to end it. I'm dreading the road ahead because I know how Rocky it's going to be...

"Was this a true friendship? TL;DR (?) A friend that I have know for 15 years just blocked me on facebook. I have always had feelings for her but I had began to move on. I don't have a lot of friends and I always liked having her as a friend and as someone I could go to. She was willing to do this with me even when she was dating someone else. As she got more serious with the other guy she started to talk to me less and less and she started to not chat with me as much about her life but she always wanted to hear about my problems and woes. I really started to feel that something was wrong when she recently got married. We had talked about marriage a few times in previous years. She had indicated that she was unsure if she would ever get married then she said she was considering it with her bf. Then one day she moved to a the same city as her husband to be but when I asked her about why or if she was considering marrying him she said she moved because she liked it there more. She hid the fact that she was engaged from me but still allowed a friendship. I know that it shouldn't have mattered that she was getting married but I did want to be supportive of it and I also wanted to know because I felt that it would be unappropriate for us to be the same type of friends that we were. One day I called her to tell her some really bad news about something that had happened in my life. I called several times but she didn't answer because she was busy. She finally returned my call at midnight and got onto me for calling her so much and then said ""I can't do this"". Then she put severe restrictions on it saying that I could only talk to her in sever circumstances or to tell her things but she would never initiate contact with me or make small talk with me. I got fed up and told her that it wasn't true friendship if she wouldn't reciprocate communication or tell me about major things in her life getting married. I also brought up some things from the past that made me feel the way that I feel towards her. Then she blocked me on facebook and told me that she wanted to discontinue all communication altogether. I feel like she knew that she had be wrong with me in the past but refused to admit it to me. Was this ever a true friendship? Am I wrong for feeling like my heart was torn out because of what she did? Is what she did OK from her end? Was she wrong or could she have been better about communicating this with me? I just don't know how to process what happened and I feel bad but I still feel that if I am going to call somebody a friend, I should be able to talk to them about life without limitation. I do know there are boundaries but just making small talk shouldn't violate a boundary. I am just looking for validation. I still do care about her as a person.

"I think I'm having a nervous breakdown I've struggled off and on for about 10 years with anxiety and depression. The latter half has been mostly on. Recently my psychiatrist changed my medication from Zoloft to Effexor because the Zoloft had pretty much plateaued and then started working less. I don't think the Effexor is having a very good effect on me. My depression has been worse than ever. On top of that I found out that my dog has bone cancer and likely won't live more than 8-12 months.

"How should I deal with this flaky friend?

Since she's super flaky I always call her out on it or joke about it. for example: In our group chat another friend will make plans and she'll be like ""ok its set"" and then i'll reply like ""that only means it's half set"" and I know I'm being snarky and all but she deserves it for being such a flake! right? Anyway I guess it really annoys her when i do this so she confronted me about it calling me a bitch for always making jokes about her being flaky and asked me not to do it anymore. I agreed but I kind of wish I didn't and now i feel like not even replying when we talk in our group chat. Im sure making snarky comments about someone being a flake can't be anywhere near as annoying as constantly being flaked on, Right?

"Rolling down hill Hi all, It all started last year when I quit my bachelor in Physical Therapy. That study didnt seem right for me and I dropped out in feb 2016. From februari till september I've worked a depressing job in an order picking centre to pay for my next year of college. But after that there wasnt any motivation for anything left over in me. This year I started a new study, lifesciences. It started all fun for the first two months. Because we had the basics of chemistry, anatomy, algebra and physics. But in the beginning of november the second semester started and thus I had tests from the first semester. Failed them all. In the weeks leading to the tests I couldnt concentrate or motivate myself to do anything. I was just at my room doing absolutely nothing. 14 november was my birthday, turned 19. Everyone forgot it except my gf (for 2,5 years). Was a fun day and made me forget the test results and gave me a little hope. Today she told me she was seeing someone else for the last 3 months because I had too little time to see her, because I was always busy with school. Im feeling that everything is worse. My job sucks but I have to keep it as I got to keep up with school costs. Already got pretty hefty debt from those two halve years of university. I just feel that everything that I do fails. Like the last 2 years I've accomplished nothing. I would like to travel if I'm going to have my second gap year but my funds wouldnt allow it. Working would be my only option but the only jobs that are available will push me over the edge.

I love learning new things (and since I have an awful memory- you can teach me the same thing three times and I’ll be excited every time lol) I am currently studying to be a middle grades teacher in the fields of science and social sciences.

I really want someone who i can share my daily life with, and they can share theirs with me. Funny pictures, goofing off, hard experiences we encounter, the whole nine. I miss having that connection with someone. I’m not looking for a specific gender, age, or region. I just wanna spend my time and experiences with someone who will become special to me!(: I’m not sure if this helps or hurts me here- but, I’m not really into anime or gaming (I thought I would throw that in there because of the people on here seem to enjoy those things) A lot of people also tend to be into computer science, and that’s okay! But, I’m going to tell you now that I’m pretty technologically impaired so I won’t be able to hold a conversation about it with you :P If you’re okay will all of these things then just shoot me a message, I can’t wait to meet you!(:",Does the poster suffer from depression?,no

"Not fearing any consequences for our actions? ""Not fearing any consequences or not fearing anything"" is one of the feelings I have observed in myself. I am not able to study well, yet when test comes, I have no fear of the consequences of the failing tests, even though I am certainly failing it. Same with my other habits, I eat like once in a day, which is an obligation I have put on myself to do at least once. Even then its very less than what any normal person of my age eats. I barely get 4-6 hours of sleep due to my schedule and not able to sleep quickly at night. I know its not healthy, but aren't we supposed to do these things by fearing what will happen to ourselves?

"Does anyone else imagine their depression as being much more 'dramatic' than it actually is? I always think of my depression as being something quite mysterious and I dramatise it in my own mind. It's as if my brain is just trying to make something of depression, which ultimately makes it worse because it gives part of my brain comfort in depression, as it least it gives me some kind of identity. I imagine it as being this huge struggle with myself, almost like a character in a movie or a book and glorify the worst parts of it to provide myself with any comfort I can.

"Lonely and stupid. I feel so stupid. I've always been academic and studious- if anything, I've dedicated my existence to the pursuit of knowledge, at the expense of forming human relationships. But I'm constantly overwhelmed by how much I don't know, how slow I am to understand concepts, and how my peers are all more intelligent than me. I know it's impossible to always be the smartest person in the room, but I feel that the fruits of my studies are disproportionate to my efforts. At the same time, I have conflicting feelings over my loneliness. I desire human interaction, but others find me rigid and distant. In all honesty, I'm easily bored by small talk and trivial discussions. I understand that it's important in forming friendships, but my under-stimulated brain seems to automatically 'shut-off' after a while. I've noticed that the people I do get along with are like me. Introverted, cold, and academic. We do not see each other as people, but as enlightened books with fresh concepts. These ideas are interesting to explore. If the book is lost, we are disappointed but not crushed. We were never bound by friendship; we were tied by our interests and perhaps mutual isolation. I don't feel an ounce of human warmth from these acquaintances.",Does the poster suffer from depression?,yes

"I’m trying to get communication back with my best friend. I have an idea, it won’t be easy and it may never work, but it’s worth a shot? Long story short: I’ve been depressed and I have a friend. I could make a 5 paragraph story about my friend and my depression. But I want to get to the point. I don’t want to make this post too long otherwise no one will read it. My friend made the decision to stop communication with me until I go to a residential psychiatric program or somewhere similar. The thing is I’ve been in one already, it was a pretty flexible place, cell phones were allowed, doors were never locked, etc. Long story short I became “too high risk” and am not allowed back. And I don’t want to go back. I don’t believe in happiness by mental health, I believe in natural happiness. I believe that all humans deserve to feel happy without being told “your life sucks so you need pills and mental health treatment to be happy.” So anyways, I can’t fulfill his wish. But getting communication back with him is all I want. There are no exceptions. So here’s my idea. Just for fun I livestream games on YouTube. I do it for fun, not for fame, I don’t play those popular games, I play the ones that no one plays. It’s unlikely for a video to get more than 100 views. But I’ve considered starting a new channel. I will livestream games, post videos about my custom Guitar Hero songs (I do that for fun too) and just pretty much show that I’m having fun. But the big goal of the channel will be to “get my friend back”. That’ll be the whole idea. That will be written on every video. That’s what the channel art will say. Think of it as a gofundme, only I’m not asking for money, I’m asking for support from the public to hear my story, hear what I’m doing, and to be there with me when my friend does deliver. Here’s the catch. For obvious reasons, his name will never be revealed. No one will have any idea who my friend is. But little by little, I will try to reveal the channel to him. It’ll start with the channel being named “Ian”, then sooner or later add my last name. As time goes on I’ll try and find ways to give him clues about the channel without actually telling him anything. The big dream is that he eventually discovers the channel, and with whatever support there is, he will see how much I’ve mentally improved over however long it takes. This all may sound totally silly, totally bogus, yeah, maybe this will never work in a million years. Just a wild thought that I’m going to attempt anyways.

"Husband in hospital and I am at a complete loss Hi all long time lurker first time poster. Using a throw away since it would destroy my husband if he saw this. I am on mobile and a bit sleep deprived, so sorry for the format or dreaded grammar errors. TLDR at bottom. Honestly I don’t need advice I just need to let everything out now before i explode. And (un)fortunately my husband is my best friend leaving me feeling alone with no one to talk to. I have a 20month old and am 35 weeks pregnant. My husband for the last few weeks has been feeling nauseous and out of sorts. I finally convinced him to go to a redicare. Well those jerks turned him away since they can’t help with abdominal pain. I wasn’t with him or they would have seen him. He ended up going to another urgent care. There they realized he had a bp of 220/112. First annoyance if the first place took his vitals we could have headed straight to the ER. We met up and got him there right away. We were at the ER for several hours before they made the decision to admit him to the cardiac unit of the hospital. Since then they have discovered a kidney issue and have not gotten a handle on the bp. They have no answers but seem to be coming up with more questions. He isn’t even 30 so the fact this is happening is extremely bizarre. His mother was here to help, but I am at my wits end and needed to be alone this evening. We just moved our daughter to a toddler bed Saturday which is doing great at night but she hasn’t napped in 3 days. She is crabby and obviously confused since daddy isn’t home. She is also in a phase where hitting mommy is funny. She hit me today and I just burst into tears. Which according to my mil is my hormones which really helped the situation. I can’t sleep and am vomiting from pregnancy and stress. I know I have to be strong for her and him and unborn, but I am failing. I spent 2 hours tonight just crying. I keep losing my temper with my daughter. I wish I could be at the hospital with him. I feel stranded, alone and useless. I don’t know how I can help him. He is spiraling down into a pit of depression and I have no way of helping him out. I keep calling and texting him which I can tell he doesn’t want. We are going to visit tomorrow morning then my mom is going to come here tomorrow so I can go see him again without the little one. But I haven’t been home much the past 2 days and I know it is taking a toll on her. I just recently became a stay at home which has created separation anxiety issues. I feel torn between to 2 people who mean the world to me and I am failing both of them. If you made it this far I guess the only question I have is does anyone have experience with this and how can I help him and her get through this? TLDR: Husband has crazy high bp and hospitalized. I feel like I am failing helping him and my toddler get through this. I feel like I have no one to talk to. Being 35 weeks pregnant is not making anything easier.",Does the poster suffer from depression?,no

"I want to pay off my debt then kill myself. I came from a really poor family, worked hard during primary and secondary school. Got a scholarship for college which paid me 10k a year as well as covering my school fees. Gave parents the money, it paid for the bills as well as my siblings's school fees. Thought life was good, studying what i love. However, i got bullied until i cant take it anymore and requested a change of class, the school rejected my request. I then requested to take a semester off school, but the contract for the scholarship states that i have to complete school by 3 years or the contract will be terminated. Failed a module and i have to extend my time in college by a year, which caused my scholarship to be terminated. Which in turn placed me in a 30k debt. Now, i don't have money to pay for school, so i had to leave. Im out without any qualifications except for a secondary school cert, with the organisation that offered me the scholarship requesting 1k per month for installments. I've always looked forward to my dream job, i was so close, i volunteer every weekend to get experience from that job. Now it feels like everything is taken from me. I appealed to have my scholarship reinstated 3 times, explaining the issues that i had, giving them the medical reports from my doctors, bringing up the volunteer work i did. But on the latest attempt, i got a call saying that they never planned to accept my appeal. It really feels like everything is taken from me.

I freeze over, my body locks up, my fear paralyzes me, and my mind becomes my enemy... Night seems endless because I can't see much of anything no matter where I try to look.

I have a really good long-term boyfriend, everything I need and a lot of things I just want. I've been ""depressed"" as long as I can remember.

"I've lost 4 Marines to depression and almsost lost a 5th. None saw combat. I need help understanding. Hi. I just had my 4th funeral in 7 years for yet another Marine. A few days ago another one called me with a gun to his head and i talked him down. These 5 Marines, as far as i can tell suffer/suffered from depression. Pretty much every one of them was intelligent (like way too smart for the Marine Corps) and each of them stood out as ""the funny one"". To say very few people understood they were struggling would be an understatement. The Marine Corps has done a lot to try and help suicidal Marines, but all our training videos depict some ""clearly distressed"" person telegraphing an intent to harm themselves. In reality none of these people let on the depth of their suffering and only one made an attempt to seek help. What I'm asking: As someone who has never suffered depression (Ive been ""depressed"" but that was from external factors like a job not working out or a girl leaving me. I consider that normal human emotion), how do I identify Marines under my care thst may be suffering and need help. They are NOT giving the outward signs in the stupid ""Lance Corporal Decker video"" we watch once a year. Thanks. Edit: been at work all day then went to visit a former Marine that dealt with some serious issues in his day but is doing well now. Mulled over a lot of this with him, then checked back in here and saw all these wonderful responses. I have read every one, some several times. I have a lot to consider and learn, but thank you for helping me find some direction. One thing i didn't mention is my role in all this. Im not sone big wig commander with tools at my disposal. Im a newly promoted Sergeant and a squad leader with just a handful of guys under me. The one we just burried was not in my platoon, but i knew him enough to be deeply saddened by his loss. The other three were guys i was close to back in training, but i was not currently stationed with them when it happened. In fact i found out about all three of them on Facebook. This recent one, and the one that called me with suicidal thoughts, have made me want to be much more aware of the mental health of those around me. The scary thing to me is, even with hindsight, i wouldn't have picked these five guys out of the lot as having ANY kind of issues, let alone suicidal tendencies. I have also noticed, maybe because of my nature or leadership style, that im the one people tend come to with problems. I make it known that im here for that purpose, and people take me up on it. So I guess now i want to make sure i can spot when someone needs more help than they may be openly asking for. I will be more vigilant in my assessments of the needs of those under my watch.

I got a little controlling with the planning of the trip and that caused some tension.

"A Long Story So here’s the situation I was and still sort of am in a group of four friends (friends for about 3 years). One of our four was a new girl who we added to the group about half of a year ago. But a few weeks ago three of us pranked the new girl’s best friend, it did not go well and suddenly the NG stopped hanging out with our group (we hangout but mostly play games online). But what I wouldn’t learn till the following week was that she wasn’t hanging out with me and rest of the group was hanging out her behind my back. They lied about having things to do, or saying the were simply to busy to spend time together. When we did hangout the other two and I they both acted odd and withdrawn, I attempted to dig into why and even asked if it specifically related to NG but I got backlash for doing so so I let up. However later I learned about her not wanting/being to hangout with me was a “intervention” where the three of them sat me down and told me that NG’s BF old her that She couldn’t be friends with me anymore because her BF told her that it was all my fault and she had to choose between me and her BF in addition I learned that why my friends had been harsh and avoided me earlier in the week, they had lied to me about the whole situation. They knew about the ultimatum that NG’s BF gave her the whole week and decided not to tell me till now, they claim it was to save my feelings but it didn’t come off that way. The “Intervention” ended with her leaving and me leaving as well. The next couple of weeks are bad not only is our group divided, I am the odd man out they spend the bulk of their time with NG and ignore me for the most part. So I confront my two friends (one I’ve been friends with for five years and the other three), I tell them it’s unfair that I am getting the short end of this situation when she made the decision to break up the group, I also tell them that the fact that they were willing to lie and go behind my back is wrong and that they justify it by claiming that NG is the victim because she lost a friend (so did I). They have apologized for the lying and going behind my back but I told them that I don’t feel comfortable with them spending time with her and being friends with all the problems she caused me and their easy willingness to lie for her to me. They tell that they will always be friends with her and that I can’t ask them to cut her off because it would divide the group, even though she already divided the group by pushing me out and they did nothing about it as a matter of fact the backed her up and supported her decision. So I told them that I have too walk away from the group then because I don’t feel valued, respected, or able to trust them after what they have done. Am I in the wrong? What should I do should I walk away? I don’t want to throw away my two closest friends but I feel like they don’t even care about me anymore.

I live with toxic parents .I feel like i have been in an endless loop with no end in sight to the pain I'm in. I hate my existence. I have done therapy,yoga blah blah. I still feel miserable. I am so unlucky. Can't do anything right. What's the point if you're not good at anything. Im below average in life,no money,No job,No talent and no interest. I don't get it.

"My stepmom wont let me back in my old home, mixed feelings. My wife is pregnant with our second child and she didn’t want to keep it at first because raising one is tough but two sounds impossible. With rent + daycare + my wife stop working for a year was going to be a squeeze. I reassured her my dad is retired they have a live in house keeper/cook, 5 bedroom house. That we can move back in and help him with sone rent. My sister just gotten a job as a doctor and shes out. The house is empty aside from my half brother whos in high school. My dad said yes of course but the following month my dad said my stepmom wasn’t feeling it. She want space and doesn’t really want to be around kids that often. My dad offered money but it was about help. I thought it was a win win. My dad was complaining earlier how he was bored and he is working part time since ss and pension wasn’t enough. I was going to pay rent. And I thought grandparents like kids. I wasn’t expecting them to raise them. I can understand my stepmom side but i cant help but feel if my mom was still around this wouldn’t have been an issue. My dad doesn’t care but he has to look out for his wife. My wife is stressed out and upset at me for acting like they would help us. I been saving to buy a house for awhile i guess i will have to dig into those. And its a reality check for me your 33 years old and your parents cant always get your back. My father has helped me alot i am always thankful. But my stepmom and I always butting heads.

"Anyone else feel they are unloveable? TLDR: I feel I have no friends and anybody I get close to leaves I started noticing I was always unhappy and sad in my last year of high school. I didn’t understand the point of life anymore and everyday driving to school I just thought how easy it was to drive off a cliff on the way to school. I got scared and told my parents who helped me get professional help. I confided in my 3 best friends at the time and almost immediately I noticed 2 of them stopped talking to me. The third I’m still friends with but not nearly as close as I used to be. When I went to college, my roommate and I became best friends but a year later, he decided to drop out and leave. I realize this is through no fault of my own but it still sucks losing a best friend. Finally, my 3rd year of college, I met the most amazing woman. With her help, I felt like I finally defeated depression. We dated for 2 years and I was so sure we were gonna last. However, I got a job on the east coast whereas we were both from the west coast. We decided we could last through the distance so I took the job and moved 3000 miles away. She just told me it wasn’t working out and broke up with me. She was my best friend and my girlfriend for 2 years. I never felt a connection with anyone else as strong as I did for her. Now I’m fearing my depression may have come back. I’m thinking I didn’t defeat depression but instead had her to use as a support. I’m here on the east coast of the US and I have no friends or family around me. I don’t know what to do and everyday I just feel like it’s me vs the whole world. I’ve already lost all hope and I feel like I don’t deserve happiness. Why else would happiness be ripped from me every time I feel like I found it. Sorry for the long post I just didn’t know where else to turn to",Does the poster suffer from depression?,yes
"Can depression make you see only the 'negative' aspects of your SO? I don't know what to think anymore. I'm in a relationship and maybe we're just not meant to be. Did depression ever cause you to only see the negative aspects of your SO? Like you thought to yourself: ""His nose looks weird"" or ""I don't like his hair"" or ""His teeth aren't even"". Things that didn't bother you before... Or that you didn't pay attention to but now now you do? I'm so desperate. :(",Does the poster suffer from depression?,yes
"I miss my best friend and they miss me I'm 12 and my best friend is 11. We both have the same birthday and were best friends last year. So this year I chose to homeschool for something. And during this year I've barely seen my best friend. I would ask my mom a lot to setup some weekly hang-out with him but it never got to happen.During this time we've found a soccer team to play on together. One practice, we got to talk after. During this chat he mentioned him always asking his mom to let me come to his house. I stated I did the same thing. That night it made me glad he wanted to hang out with me all the time. About 5 days later I realized what this chat meant. Really when he stated that he asked his mom about me coming over a lot, he was practically saying he missed me. And when I stated the same thing back I was saying the same thing. I learned it was a test of friendship from him, and that we were both thinking the same thing, missing eachother a lot. Right now, we're both just waiting for a weekly hang-out to happen. During this wait, we're both sad; what's the best thing for me to do when we're waiting? Should I try and talk to him more? (he doesn't have any way of texting me at the time)",Does the poster suffer from depression?,no

"How do I deal with feeling worthless? I’ve had a bad day and this is on top of just a long few years of my life where I can’t remember the last time I’ve truly been happy. I have a few friends but the more my life has gone on, the more I’ve realized certain dislikings i have towards them. I want to meet new people and do new things, something that my friends aren’t interested in or don’t have time for. I’m as bad as you could imagine when it comes to making new friends because I can be really socially awkward and I’m convinced that few other people share specific interests that I would look for in friends or a girlfriend. I have few (if any) aspirations in life and I just feel like I’m drifting through life without any idea what I want. I don’t feel like I’ve accomplished much in my life, I’m in college but I’ve never held a job before and I’m hardly passionate enough about a career to really be interested to want to pursue it. Maybe this sounds like a really pathetic post but I honestly don’t know what to do. I just feel alone and unmotivated to do anything in life.",Does the poster suffer from depression?,yes

"Having troubles reconnecting with an old friend. Aloha Reddit. So I'm a guy and I'm trying to reconnect with an old female friend of mine. Long story short, she stopped talking to me and then I stopped talking to her but she thought I was the one who stopped talking to her and so we ignored eachother for three years even though we go to the same school. Recently, I texted her saying that I apologize. She said that she'd give me a second chance, so I start texting her questions to get to know her again, but she takes hours to answer and when she does answer, all she says is ""Yes/no, you?"" When I ask her a question and ""Haha ok"" when I answer my own question. She even leaves me on read sometimes. Should I stop texting her? I really don't understand why she decided to give me a second chance if she won't even try to support the conversation.

"Help...Relationship with my depressed, mentally messed up friend This is my first time posting on reddit, sorry if I have made any mistakes. This post is gonna be quite long. To start with, my friend and I are both 15 year olds living in Hong Kong and we study in the same school. She is a great person, very special, someone I can never forget. The problem is that she is the kind of person who smiles in front of people but is actually depressed. And I feel like I will just make things worse. Because of her laughs and near-crazy actions, nobody knows her true feelings. In fact she constantly complains about everything, being unpopular, being immature, the education system here, her online friends, just to mention a few. She is tired and feels like a loser all the time. Games and cosplaying is the only way she escapes from reality. I don't mind listening to rants. It's ok to be sad. But I seriously do not know how to respond when she comes up with questions related to suicide. During lessons my friend would show me long paragraphs about her self hate and ask for my reply. A typical example of our conversation: ""Why am I so unpopular?"" ""..."" ""WHY AM I SO UNPOPULAR."" ""...maybe you have different hobbies and interests from most people?"" Then she starts to regret her choices, why did she choose to study in this school, if she had been in another school, she would have been happier... etc. In her letters, she questioned about the meaning of life. She wrote about ""nightmares"", ""thought crimes"" and ""leaving the endless circle of life"". That left me terrified. All I could do is to sit next to her speechless. If I said something wrong she would just jump off from the roof. Not to mention all those confusing philosophical questions. I can never give an answer simply because I don't know how. I once asked the school social workers how to talk to a depressed friend. Her advice was literally trash, and I ended up crying when I talked about her suicidal thoughts. I have no idea what to do. The next day when you see her at the school gates, she puts on that smile again, but she definitely has problems. Anyone has experience in dealing with such friends? Depressed friends who smiles all the time? It sounds weird to ask what I can do for you, because she normally won't respond (at least I think so).

So there’s that, on top of it, this past week someone I’d consider a close friend was having problems with this guy she’s kinda friends with and something happened and she blocked him and I pestered her about it because I wanted to see if I could help and she got mad at me and stormed off. Everyone else with us started ganging up on me saying stuff like “This is why nobody likes you” and then my other friend comes over and tells them to keep me in the room (Theater stuff). Now everyone seems fine with me but it really upset me and I don’t know what I can do to change it. They said I ask the wrong questions and I feel like I just want to be included.

"college- medical withdrawal for a semester Okay, so I'm thinking about either doing a course load reduction or a medical withdrawal due to my anxiety and depression.

If I manage to get a course load reduction, does anyone have any ideas for things I can do to help myself get better during this semester? If it ends up not working out, does anyone know about other ways I can go about making this semester less stressful?

"[Need Advice] Need anti depressants but I don't want my mum to know about it. Hello guys, I am 17 and I live in Singapore with my Mum. I have been depressed on and off for the past 5 years with serious suicidal thoughts for the last 4. I really think that it's time that I start anti depressants because I reckon it would help me tons. The problem is, I don't want my mum to know because the last time I opened up about being slightly suicidal and very depressed, she freaked out on me (don't need to get into details.) She has had a history with it herself and I know that if i ever took my life, it would permanently ruin her. At this point, medication is my last resort. I've had a girlfriend and it made no difference whatsoever, I still feel empty most of the time and would rather die than anything else.

The thought of all those innocent people murdered just so that the westerners can live comfortably, it just makes me sick.

"My Friend is Draining Me Apologies, this is a very long post! I’ve been good friends with a girl for around 10 years since we were teenagers. She moved overseas around 5 years ago. She used to be such a fun, bubbly and funny person until she met her boyfriend around 3 years ago. Looking back, I can see that she was a always bit crazy and insecure (her father is emotionally abusive and tells her she’s worthless and stupid), but meeting him seems to have exacerbated all her bad qualities. She has a really low self esteem and perception issues when it comes to relationships. She also has OCD. She was, and still is OBSESSED with her now ex boyfriend. They had an on off relationship where she thought it was normal to call him “just ten times” in one day, and would get upset and not be able “sleep or eat” if he doesn’t reply, thinks talking on the phone three times a day is not much, they pushed and shoved each other, she hit him, he talked to other girls and acted like she wasn’t his girlfriend, she’d call his voicemail just to hear his voice, he threatened to hurt her, she considered going to a shitty college just to be near him, etc.. basically an abusive and obsessive relationship with awful communication. Every time she messages me, she’ll ask how I am and ask a few questions, and then steer the conversation back to her numerous problems and her ex. About how she’s so poor (goes out every second night and goes on shopping sprees), how she’s really sad (but won’t see a counselor because she’s “too poor”), how she wants to be confident and independent (goes back to the ex repeatedly and doesn’t listen to any of the advice I give her), tells me she can’t eat or sleep because she’s heartbroken (I told her I was eventually okay after I broke up with an ex, but she brushed it off as I hadn’t gone out with him for as long and how she gave everything to her ex). She also says how I’m so lucky to live with my boyfriend and how I have such an amazing life, as if she’s the only person in the world that has problems. I’ve talked to her multiple times about how talking about her ex all the time and her problems is effecting me (as well as her other friends), and how she should really see a professional as this behavior is really hurting her. She always apologizes and says that she didn’t realize how it might make me annoyed, and she’ll send me an inspirational video or inspirational words, and asking about me before going back to changing the topic so she can talk about herself, her ex and how it’s so hard for her right now, how she feels suffocated and her heart is broken. I understand that people go through hard times in their lives, but this has lasted at least 3 years. I’ve always said how I’ll be there for her and that if she needs to talk to someone, I’ll listen, but I’m starting to feel that this is a one way relationship. The frustrating thing is that she says she agrees to everything I say, and how’s shes going to change, but nothing has changed! She says she’s more confident and doing this and that to help herself, but she just plasters selfies and videos of herself going out with people to try and convince people that she’s having an amazing time. I don’t want to just ignore her, but I don’t think talking to her again will do anything. I’ve been nice, brutally honest, and even angry at her and nothing has changed. She’s stuck in her own tragic world and I’m realizing that maybe she thrives in this drama, and that she’s lonely and needs a boyfriend’s attention to validate her self worth . Our other mutual friend has cut ties with her due to this. I think I have put up with this for so long as we’re not living in the same country..

"Not invited to my friend's wedding. Is it time to abandon ship? A guy I have been close friends with for the last 13 years is getting married this year and I've come to the realisation that I'm not invited to the wedding. To be honest, we are not as close as we used to be. We used to hang out all time, but as lives became busy, we spent less time together. I still attend almost all of his social gatherings, though that is probably only 3 to 4 times a year. The weird thing is, I was invited to his engagement party. I got him and his partner a really meaningful gift that they still comment on whenever they see me, yet they didn't invite me the wedding. When I was slightly intoxicated at another friend's girls night some time ago, I asked the bride if invites had been sent out yet because I couldn't remember receiving mine. We then began the awkward exchange in which she told me it was really hard to narrow down the guest list and I realised I was never getting my invite. I tried to act as if I wasn't offended and that I understood, but honestly, I'm really hurt. I've been invited to the hen's night which is in a month. It is not a cheap night. Upwards of $200 for accommodation, games etc. It feels rude to expect me to pay so much to attend a hen's night when they wouldn't even pay for me to be a guest at their wedding.

"Today, my mother tried to commit suicide. Due to recent family events, it awakened childhood feelings of abandonment, inadequacy, and loneliness in my mom. She felt alone. Luckily, she was too coward to utilize her personal firearm. She chose to drink herself into an oblivion and inhale exhaust fumes. The exhaust fumes made her tired, and in her tired stupor, she thought she could sit outside and freeze to death. She had a bottle of heart pressure medication as a backup. I thank my lucky stars that she fell asleep in the grass instead. Her attempt was unsuccessful. Originally I blamed myself for having been hard on her. I have always been honest with my mother, and she has always kept a strong face. But today I learned how fragile she truly is. I take it upon myself to protect her, and support her, no matter what. She raised me and continues to raise my younger siblings. It’s time that we give back. I have been thankful that I have not suffered the loss of someone I love to suicide. I thought that I would see the signs if it were going to happen. I didn’t. I will be more aware and I will show my love for people I care about. I often think about the ones I love but don’t take the time to reach out. That changes today. I refuse to hold back my love for fear of being hurt and pushed away, for the people I love are not hearing it enough but still stay. I am grateful for the second chance with my mother. I have thought often about missing her someday when she dies. I never thought that it might come so soon. I am renewed and reborn. My goals and ambitions stronger than ever.

"I've never talked about this to anyone I've struggled with depression since I was in 2nd grade. For the last 7 years it's gotten worst, I'm 20 at the moment. When I was 13 I was raped occasionally. Being raped when it first happen didn't bother me as much because I didnt understand what was happening until years later. What did bother me at the time was that I felt alone. I've always felt alone, never felt like anyone cared for me or about me. I fought with my mom and step dad a lot which made me feel even more lonely. I never talked about feeling lonely to anyone because I was always embarrassed about it and still do. Because me and my parents had a rocky relationship I would be abused by both at times. One time I was arguing with my mom and she ended up getting a 2 by 4 and started hitting me with it. I never rasied my hands at my parents, just talked a lot of shit and was an asshole to them. My parents kicked me out of their house when I was 14. I ended up living with my grandpa. This made me feel unwanted and even more lonely now that my parents gave up on me. I lived with my grandpa for about 9 months before he sent me back to my parents because he couldn't ""afford"" to keep me. I wasn't an asshole to my grandpa nor was I mean to him, I just was a teen who stayed up late and took long showers. My grandpa giving up on me was heartbreaking for me. I felt like no one wanted me and if I ended everything then everything would be better. I didn't even last a week at my parents house, they shipped me off to live with some family who lived in the rural country area instead of the city. I lived there for maybe 4 months and finished my freshmen year of high school there. I didn't feel welcomed anywhere I went and for the most part I felt more beyond alone. Majority of the time at my uncle's I was in my room, alone and desperate for a friend. After 4 lonely months of really being alone I was given back to my parents again. After coming home broken I learned to keep to myself. No one wanted me and no one cared. When I got back home I was sent to an all boy high school. Once again I had to go to a new school and try to fit in somehow. I was lonely for a while until I met this girl. I'm afraid to write her name incase she ever reads this and it hurts reading/writing it but I need to get this off my chest. I met this beautiful girl named Cindy at a school function. She went to the all girl school down a couple streets. Both all gender schools would make events for each other to get students that social interaction. Anyways I meet this beautiful girl named Cindy, she was nice to me and I was nice to her. We dated for over a year and while it lasted it was nice. The way she broke up with me literally broke me. I was having a really sad day and told her about how I struggle with really bad depression and that I have suicidal thoughts. Her response was ""oh"" and she slowly stopped talking to me. Eventually she stopped talking to me and when she did talk to me she made excuses about not having time to talk to me. She was my only friend, the only person I was close to. She couldn't be there for me when I needed her most, when I needed a friend most. So I stayed alone thinking maybe school was too much for her at the moment. Then one day I get on Facebook only to see her on it, I clicked on her page and saw that she had been on hanging out with friends and having the time of her life. She slowly broke me, I couldn't handle it and called her to confront her about it. She made excuses and talked about how she didnt have time for me at the moment, so she hung up and left it alone. I was reaching my breaking point, I was going to commit suicide. I sent her a text message talking about how I needed her to talk to me and be a friend because I was getting worst. She never responded to me however she did get in contact with my school to let them know what I was dealing with. I was so embarrassed that she did this to me, I felt betrayed and hurt that she made me the schools problem instead of hers. It hurt ne so bad. I was embarrassed that the school knew, I was embarrassed that my parents knew now. I wanted to kill myself more than ever now. I was so hurt by this and was angry at Cindy. I went home and tried stabbing myself. My mom went in my room to talk to me, just so happened at that moment I had a kitchen knife in my hand to stab myself. My mon fought me over it and sent me to a psychiatric hospital. I stayed there until December 23rd. At the hospital I tried killing myself twice. First time was when the guards/residents give you cracks, I ate the crackers but stuffed the wrapper down my throat. One if the residents heard me making choking nosies and came in to save me. Second time was when I started swallowing my food instead of chewing on it to choke me out again. They put me on these medications that didn't help but I acted like they did so I can go home.

I took antidepressants Cymbalta 60 mg before this during 8 months for major stress and it helped me with almost no side effects. But after i quit antidepressants Cymbalta 60 mg ,the fatigue, no motivation, sleep issues, stomach problems and concentration issues has been persistent in my life. Now for 3 years. No matter how much rest i get i feel tired. Even if excercise, eat healthy, do yoga and meditation. My blood sugar levels has been up and down lately. But even if they are controlled i feel the same. A cause could be that i have worked on a lot of projects during the past 3 years. It went as far as that i started to get suicide thoughts. I do not feel any ups or downs in my life. Things i used to like to do isles enjoyable. I rather stay at home than being social. I believe i have major depression and i have visited psychologist and psychiatrist who have advised me to take antidepressants. But the question is if I’m stressed, have major depression or simply burnt out. I certainly feel that i have a huge major depression. My OCD thought are back and i have been stuck on testing my blood sugar 10-15 times per day during the past year. Which also could bring my stress levels up. The past year has been very stressful for me work wise. But even if i get a weekend of rest i don’t feel rested. I have been to different psychiatrists and psychologist and the conclusion is either major depression or burn out. I barely have the energy to clean my apartment anymore, wash my clothes or think about my hygiene. I feel tearful occasionally on some days. I have thought about taking antidepressants again, particularly Cymbalta since it worked for me the first time. But i have been afraid of taking them. Instead my psychiatrist described me brintellix (Vortioxetine), 10 mg per day for my depression. But the question is, i’m i stressed, depressed or burnt out? Anyone have been in a similar case? Any experiences of the antidepressants brintellix (Vortioxetine) for major depression? I’m so afraid of starting to take them, but i don’t want to feel this way of every morning waking up with no motivation for anything that the day brings me.",Does the poster suffer from depression?,yes
"Bursting into tears at pigeon dying So one effect of my depression is I get really, really, really sad about some things.

"If you care, will you read? My depression has gotten really bad over the last 2 years, and today I realized something. I don't have anyone. Everyone I talk to, people I'd call 'friends' don't really care. They only notice me when I'm the one who talks first. I make plans with them, set up so much and help everyone around me, but none of them care. I skipped school to see what would happen, and nothing. No one even noticed. My parents hate me, and I'm alone. None of this really matters, and no one cares. I'm just so tired, and I want it all to just end.

"Am I crazy for wanting to get back with her? So let me give you guys a bit of a timeline first: - April 2017 we met at work, became really good friends. She still had a boyfriend, but broke up with him about 2 weeks after we started hanging out. - June 2017 I told her I liked her as more than a friend, she didn't feel this way towards me at the time. - July 2017 she started dating a guy she already knew, we'll call him Jake. - August 2017 she broke up with Jake. Jake made her feel terrible for it and cut her off completely, leaving her to say that she hated him and wanted no part of him. - September/October 2017 she told me she's always been attracted to me, but wasn't ready for a relationship. I was in love with her at this time, after knowing her for a while and her being everything I want in someone. Suggested being FWB, which I took her up on. But whenever I tried to make a move on it, she didn't seem to want to do anything. We hung out just us 2 every day, would always be talking, but for some reason when the time came around to make a move she never seemed to want to do anything. Mid October 2017 she said how we would be better off being friends since we didn't seem to be going anywhere and that it was hurting her self esteem, and that she started talking to Jake again. She is currently still dating Jake, but from what I hear from her are on the verge of another breakup. And now I want her more than ever. I was absolutely heartbroken when she cut things off with me, and I'm still not over her. And she knows this. If she cuts things off with Jake, I don't know what to do. I want her back more than anything, but at the same time it's like she put me through such pain and I don't want to chance that happening again. She is everything that I could possibly want in a girl, and I can't imagine myself without her. And we're still friends, which probably isn't helping to be honest. But she's still my best friend.

"Severe Ibs and depression combo is a death sentence Hi I posted a few times on this forum last year April sometine due to my depression and I'm posting again because well, it's back. So I'm just going to write a few things about myself and why I'm posting here. Im a 20 year old guy from London, England and I've been depressed for about 2 years now. I was also diagnosed with IBS about 7 or so years ago. I was at university for digital media and I finished. My first year but when the second year started my IBS symptoms got worse and I was I physically unable to go. thankfully the university gave me a year off and said I can start my second year next year after I get better. However it just seems to be getting worse not better. I can barely go outside without going through severe anxiety attacks which leads to horrible pains in my stomach for which I need to go home to go toilet for, when it was really bad I would feel very faint and start having panic attacks. It reached the point where I was practically housebound. I spent like 3 months playing games, watching anime and TV shows and the pains started to get a bit better. Then 2 days ago I went toilet and it happened again, severe pain, feeling very uneasy and then boom out of nowhere crippling depression, the waves just hit me. I began feeling hopeless again, I felt unsatisfied with life. Not just my life, but life in general. Thanks to my love of Anime, Webnovels, Games and Movies I started to wish my life was like that. I know it's childish, but deep down it's just how I felt. I couldn't accept reality, it was too mundane for me and I wasn't satisfied just sitting there everyday just watching or reading things. But I couldn't do anything about it because everytime I try to do something my IBS kicks in and basically cripples me. And I know that even if I try and do something, it's not really what I want. I don't want my life to be normal. All I would really be doing is trying to avoid the pain that it will never happen. I know this is long and it might be hard to emphasize with me if you don't really understand it. But I just felt like I really wanted to say something and see if maybe there were other people like me. I guess you could say I'm looking for friends who can understand me, I'm hoping that maybe it will make living a little easier if I have people to talk about the things I love with who also understand what it's like going through depression. That's the conclusion I came up with anyway Thanks for reading",Does the poster suffer from depression?,yes

"Need to talk and I have nobody. Hey all. Just need to talk, really struggling right now and trying to dig out of it. Not really sure what else to do. Pattern of behaviour: Wake up in the morning with immediate feelings of depression and loneliness. Acute feelings of being alone in bed, uncomfortable. Become compelled to flip through Bumble, Tinder because I feel a need to try and immediately correct the problem. I never (and I mean never) match. Have to fight urges to immediately abuse addictions like porn and weed. Sometimes do, sometimes don’t. Prepare for work, fight off feelings of sadness about ex-girlfriend and situation it puts me in. Fight the urge to blame her for the failure of the relationship even though I logically know I’m wrong or that’s not fair. She just left to pursue school and had to move on, she didn’t do anything to me. Fight feelings of rejection and feelings of inadequacy in my value to others even though there’s no reason to feel that here. Walk to work, continue to fight with anger issues re: relationships and validation. Sometimes frustration stems from lack of work success but more often than not it’s physical appearance issues and relationship issues. I get caught in a loop being mad at her and being mad at myself and my capacity to deal with being alone. Auto-pilot at work. Able to do job easily, so lack of focus is a non-issue. I spend too much time on Facebook and other social media looking for outlets to expand my social network and friends. Find it very difficult to do so without appearing over-anxious or creepy and new opportunities rarely prevent themselves. Sometimes Imarket business and contact clients/potential clients. Sometimes a boost comes from having success here, but often the lack thereof is equally esteem damaging. Go home, usually bus. Already tired. Immediately engage addictions, usually beer and weed. Start watching TV or playing games and rarely stop until bed time. I'll leave easy tasks like cleaning dishes, etc for weeks. Continual evasion of solving problems, instead opting to rely on substances to either forget or balance my feelings of sadness. Occasionally I have friends over, but many of them use substances as well or are in similar life situations so finding solace in these encounters is limited. Furthermore, they are my friends of many years and represent a kind of social stagnation. At night I’m usually in bed by 10, not because I’m out of things to do, but because I’m either drunk or bored. On weekends I’m lucky if I do anything outside of what I do immediately after work. I rarely feel compelled to do anything. If I get invited to a bar, I end up going and feeling alienated from everyone and ‘out-of-place’. Most of the time, I just feel too tired to join my friends, but I also feel a lack of motivation because I’m sure it’ll just be the same crowd—and it appears their lives keep moving while mine does not. I am behind on adulthood. I have only recently acquired a driver’s license, I just renewed my glasses prescription and only just started living on my own. I have to get my teeth taken care of and they are a source of stress and physical pain (still have wisdom teeth at 34). I have the habits of a teenager. I smoke copious amounts of weed, I drink daily and I don’t pursue my interests or goals. I know the right course of action most of the time, but I actively ignore it because the amount required to get healthy is just too much. I have spent a great majority of my life single and most of my relationships aside from a few gems have been tumultuous, emotional rollercoasters. More often than not, Despite all these things I feel undervalued in my society. I think of myself as smart, funny and confident in my skills, but I feel that the rest of the world doesn’t care and doesn’t see those as appealing. I feel like without looks and an academic education, you can only accomplish so much and that people’s standards are so high that competition for a good role in society is unlikely. I feel unable to compete when the above issues prevent me from succeeding. Motivation to do anything is lowered by the lack of acceptance in general, the feeling that I should be acceptable the way I am but am not, and my inability to seem to control that situation. It doesn’t help that on the face of it, most people will tell me that I seem like a “catch”, an incredibly high-value person with lots to offer—except that none of that seems to translate to my life, emotional attachments or stability. I'm just lost.",Does the poster suffer from depression?,yes

"Should family be more than this? I’m 24 and no kids and my family is just like everyone else’s around me; broken. My dad is sometimey and has kept few promises he has made to me. In the end it’s not him being bad that’s the problem, it’s that he says the problem is ME. Like with men I have talked to in the past, they can only say what I’M doing wrong not listening to me and claiming I am crazy. This behavior with my father led me to cutting off all contact late last year. My family, his side, otherwise see nothing wrong with his behavior. The issue is ME. I’m expecting too much from him.....like if he says he’s coming to our city (he lives 30 mins away) and I get upset when he doesn’t show and he’s done it just about every time. Or even when he claims he’s coming to get the dog he left with my uncle (left him there a year ago claiming it would only be for two weeks) he just lies constantly. I was raised around my family growing up. I didn’t see my father but I saw his side of the family, cousins, aunts and uncles. They may have lived states away but we always spent summers and holidays together. At this point my family on either side rarely see each other. We have family reunions that none of my cousins attend, all too busy now that their grown. At the end of the day I was told this; I’m an adult and my father has nothing to do with the things I’ve done in life, or nothing to do with the guys I used to talk to that led to constant rejection and overall cynical view on love (getting sperm donor at 28.) I should be grateful for times spent with him, five minutes should be the best in the world (he’s so self absorbed I’m only worth five minutes every few months) I have no right as a child to threaten him if he wont leave me alone for good. I don’t see why I have to live like this, I suffer from depression and constantly beatbox myself up over every mistake I make. I’m unhappy, I’ve been getting better since getting rid od him and focusing on the family that actually has time time for me. A family shouldn’t just be there for emergency. A family is thinking of others before themselves, loving one another enough to know them. Am I really expecting or demanding too much?

"A friend cut me off So recently a friend of mine cut me off and I’m not really sure why. I guess to understand my concern it would be best to get the whole story. I had first met her earlier this school year. Our desks were right next to each other in math class. Back then, she was very talkative, sociable, optimistic, and energetic around me. I’m not always the most talkative type but that didn’t seem to bother her at all. She always shouted for my attention to say hi to me when passed each other in the halls. She asked for my number, introduced me to a few of her friends, and even invited me over to her house for lunch during one of our off periods. We texted a couple times though I will admit each time I kept feeling like I was annoying her. Eventually, she had invited me to come with her boyfriend and group of friends to hang out at the mall over Christmas vacation. I was so excited. However, when the day finally came, I couldn’t help but feel like a third wheel. She was much more focused on her boyfriend than she was on anyone else and the only time she noticed me was when I had wandered off without telling any of them. That wasn’t cool of me, I admit, but I just didn’t feel needed or even wanted there at times. Later that night though, I texted her and apologized for not being that social but she it was all fine. But I still couldn’t shake the feeling that she was upset with me. When we came back from vacation, my suspicions grew. She was a lot more quiet and distant from me and was usually on her phone with her headphones in whenever I was around. It was around this time that I started to become a lot more needy. She still responded to my texts and told me that the reason she was so quiet was because she had a headache. But I couldn’t help but notice that she was still pretty social around her other friends. At one point when we were walking in the halls, she had her headphones in and didn’t say a word to me but the minute she saw one of her other friends, she took her headphones out and screamed for his attention. All while I was standing right next to her. It was a week before winter vacation when we got into an argument. You see, she was aware of my depression and offered her assistance in helping me deal with it. However, in our argument, she expressed her displeasure with how she felt she was putting in all the effort into dealing with my problems. I tried apologizing to her, probably getting a bit too dramatic about it, but she just expressed her annoyance at how I constantly needed her assurance and that if I don’t try to change myself, she won’t be my friend anymore. Eventually, I apologized for my part in the argument and how I didn’t make her help feel appreciated, but I also explained to her that I was doing something about my depression. I see a psychiatrist and take antidepressants every night. Still, she insisted that I needed to change. But by this point, whenever I spoke to her in person, she always seemed disinterested and kind of annoyed. When I asked her if she had a problem with me, she would always say that she was either busy or wasn’t in the mood for it. Eventually, she responded that she needed space for the whole vacation, so I didn’t text her at all. But when the vacation was over, I tried to text if everything was fine now only to discover that she had blocked my number. Now, she doesn’t even acknowledge my presence anymore and almost seems to actively avoid me. I apologize if this is really long. I just wanted to be as detailed as possible. At this point, I just feel at a loss and confused about what happened. I’m not sure if I did something wrong or if she was ever my friend at all. I mean, our friendship felt genuine those first months before Christmas. But now I just don’t know what to think or do.",Does the poster suffer from depression?,no
"What's the deal with my husband's future best friends wife? Hi everyone, I am having a problem and I'm not sure what to do about it. I am led to believe that my future husband's (married next month) best friend's wife dislikes me, but I'm getting mixed signals. I have always (I thought) been nice to her. When we hang out as couples, everything is fine and we get along great. We have a similar education level and both come from a science background, so it's easy for us to talk. We have spent hours hanging out in these situations. We even all took a road trip together this past summer a few states away to attend a very lovely (albeit very strange) wedding of another of their mutual friends, and we went out to dinner and shopping while the boys were at the bachelor party. It seems like whenever I try to plan anything though, she isn't available, even if her husband is. I planned a surprise party for my fiances 30th birthday that I had been talking about for months--her husband was there, and at the last minute, she couldn't attend. He didn't even tell me she wasn't coming until he showed up without her. We visited their home on 4th of July weekend and there invited them to my parents house (they have a pool) for the holiday.

"Worried about my daughter I am in such a shit situation I don't know what to do. Myself and ex partner both have a child who is nearly 8 years old. We have been separated for a number of years and i see my daughter at weekends. The mother of my daughter isn't a bad person, she had a lot of bad stuff to deal with when she was younger. She basically smokes weed to shut out all the bad stuff and usually only does this when our daughter is in bed. A lot of the time she has threatened to kill herself and this has happened in front of my daughter I'm sure which is so wrong.

"Falling for someone you have no chance to be with Warning: Super long read Have you ever fallen for someone that you know you have absolutely no chance with? It’s been 4 years since I’ve fallen for a girl back in college, which ended up in heartbreak and depression because she already found someone else. I’ve lost all motivations and my passion for arts (I’m an art student), failed my thesis which sent me into another dark place, ’friends’ were not even there to help me get up, and for the remaining years I had in college, the thing that kept me going are my parents, I just wanted to survive for them. I’ve lost all emotions, the flame that was once burning in my heart, the excitement I had when I was a freshman. I graduated college 7 months ago and found work not related to the course I took up, it felt really low, but I just wanted to survive. Training for work now, didn’t want to make friends again, had one, but he didn’t liked the people so he left in a few weeks, the only thing in my mind was to focus and be better for this job to survive. Avoided lunch and hanging out with workmates, and didn’t really reveal much about myself aside from having a mundane life. The trainers were aware of my introversion and decided to have random sitting arrangements every week so we could get to know our workmates more, and I could get to talk about other stuff aside from work. 3 weeks in training and still, I didn’t made any connections, I only help out my workmates professionally, point out mistakes and the next step they should take. I get to be sit mates with the liveliest girl in training, playful and have a contagious ’happy’ aura(?). There were also a few talks and laughs about work related stuff, but I didn’t really made efforts to start it, she was always the one that engages first (and that’s because she’s an extrovert and does this to everyone anyways). Being around her, hearing her voice, seeing her smile felt something, it felt like the flame that I lost 4 years ago came back. But, what made me fell the most is that she’s intelligent as well and speaks in English flawlessly (I live in a country outside US). I can also relate to her because she suffers from clinical depression and requires therapy sessions every now and then (everyone in training knows this anyways because she told the class from the get-go). I didn’t really asked her out for lunch or coffee, I really wanted to so I could get to know her better and be friends with her, be her guide in her darkest days, but my introversion and over thinking always gets the best of me. There were only a few times she joined me and my friend during a coffee break where I found out a few things about her. There were times that I see the sadness beyond her smile, and times where her depression was clearly visible and affected me greatly. I always think about scenarios - if the conditions were right - where I get to talk with her and lend a helping hand, at the end of the day they only remain as thoughts. I know she doesn’t think about me like how I think about her. Every time our shift ends, I leave the office quickly and ignore the feelings I have for her, my mind is at a constant battle on whether or not to ask her for lunch, ask her if she’s ok. It’s even worse at night, whenever I see her late night tweets about her depression, a part of me just wants to be there for her, and the other part gives me the realization of how pathetic I am and that I don’t deserve her. I know that she had an ex-bf that broke her heart, and currently has a gf (she’s bi). Yet, she still gives me inspiration in every photo I take. I really don’t know what is wrong with me, I’m being tormented by my own mind and I still like it. Knowing that she already has someone in her heart, yet still seeing her depressed at times (and looking at her tweets), really makes me want to step up and do something, but held back by my own tormented soul. Next week would be the last week in training, after that we’re going to get split up into teams and do actual work, but still go back to class to share our experience and reflect upon them. One could only hope for a miracle that I gain the strength and courage to talk to her more and be a part of her life. I really hate this feeling, yet this pain fuels my passion even more.",Does the poster suffer from depression?,yes

"I'm a daca recipient and I fucking hate it. I was born in Mexico and brought to the US when I was 3. This of course means I'm one of those ""nasty illegals"" everyone seems to hate. My goal has always been success. Ever since I was a kid I daydreamed of owning a mansion with fancy gates, a huge lawn, a big pool. This was always my goal. I wasn't going to accept living in poverty like my parents or having an ""average"" life. So I worked hard for it. I was always top of my class, I was on the dean's honor list in college, I started (and failed) my first few businesses, joined clubs, went to a lot of events to meet people, and landed an internship. I was even in the middle of starting my next business. I also got my credit score up to almost 800 and started funding my retirement/investment account. Because my whole life has been focused on success, I attempted suicide a few times when I found out I was illegal and couldn't even go to college in high school. Obviously they all failed. However in 2012, the year before I graduated, Obama passed daca. Because I had been here since I was a toddler, was going to finish school, and didn't have even a single misdemeanor, I was able to get a social security number, a work permit, a driver's license, open investment accounts, and received protection from deportation. Now Trump has ended it. The final decision will be made in early August, but it's most likely going to be rescinded. What am I supposed to do then? Just fucking accept losing everything? Everything I worked towards will have been for nothing. Even if daca continues, am I supposed to just keep living in fear of it ending again forever? I'm losing all my fucking hair stressing over this. I've had a cold for months that hasn't gone away, and everything hurts. I can't even talk to anyone about this. Everyone just tells me to man up and work some shitty job picking fruit in the fields. No one understands that I actually have goals in life. I refuse to accept a life where I work 60 hours a week, breaking down my body, for $30k a year with no room for advancement and living in fear every day. I've never been fond of life in the first place. The only thing that ever gave me happiness was growing my net worth, and pretty soon I won't even be able to do that. Why shouldn't I end it all at that point? That's it. I needed to rant. I'm sorry if I sound like a spoiled brat. TL:DR: I rely on daca to have an even somewhat decent life. It's being taken away. I'm losing everything.",Does the poster suffer from depression?,yes
"My Fictional Home I stared outside, and watched the cold atmosphere awake me. The sun’s rays blocked by the magnificent beauty above us all; an urban scape filling my view around me. I felt a grave sadness strike all in the same spots for my daily routine, crippling what was left of my head. I grabbed the bicycle, and went along the path to any good in my life. ‘A nearly missed accident up ahead,’ I reminded myself. I hit the button to change colors, and awaited a stop that could mean a sour tardiness or a decent morning. The color changed fast, and I hastily sped across the lines between me and the other side. I arrived, striking the pavement at full speed ahead down the rubber sidewalk. A straight path to follow, a new future to envelop soon enough. The fact of the matter was that I had to pray to a god I didn’t believe in if I wanted to warp my happy spirit to glorious utopia. Logic overrides hearts quite rarely, leaving a snowflake and a shock of noise behind the mind that just wants it all to change. My bored mind only somewhat consciously bobbed his head around from side to side, keeping an eye on the reflective sign for a change of heart. The observant man coming by on a bicycle or on his own two legs could notice the hurting expression that shone on my face. An insomnia that has outlasted its course, half a heart to spare to the one it belongs to, and the tonnes lying on his stubby shoulders. Whether the man is out to care for their dog, the mail, something; they always take a look to glance at the face of a broken child, often not realizing the fine details in the street lights glowing on my frozen cheeks. ‘What did it take to find redemption?’ I often wondered, as grand sunlight was walking upstairs to knock the moon off it’s sleepy stool. I sat and watched a beautiful red giant approach, and drew images in mind to flicker about and echo in my concave dome of secrets. As the flickering opportunity ran full speed in front of me, I turned and felt the imagery toss into the incinerator. A great insecurity washed over the industry working ahead up above, slowing me down as I walked in slowly toward the place to call work. I sat the bicycle at it’s rack, hands in pocket as I blinked at the glaring sun. A numbness hit my heart, and for the next eight hours, I’d lose who I was, only coming back at the rise of a pounding rain. I walked from a distant building, taking the long path to a home that didn’t know me. I took the rugged bicycle, and stared up above at the shadowy clouds. I leaned forward over the handlebars, watching the patterns fly past my visions. I lifted up again, opening my voice to play a tune, looking for a face to redeem my little work. I went onward, and stared at the home that forgot me. I walked slowly up, placing the bicycle just where it was, hitting the kickstand which had sacrificed my ankle some. I opened the door, giving a brief greeting. I entered the meeting room of regrets and lost innocence, stroking my hands over what was a cuddly friend. My vision blurred, feeling the great exhaustion from the night prior taking me over. I curled in the corner, feeling the toilets flushing the pent up pains from an earlier disembarkment of a peanut gallery. I hugged the one thing that brought a soothing to my life, and proceeded to let out an ugly sob, trying to remember who everyone was, as I grabbed a broken mirror, staring at who the blurry stranger was in it. I felt myself faint, awaking to two strangers cycling the door between storage and the hands of all waiting for me. “What were you thinking?” the woman asked, “What did you say?” the man asking. “I don’t know.” I responded, lying on my side, as they both awkwardly stepped out, with a cracked expression of what was me walking out. I felt a blankness ride across my body, as I stared upon a wall that reminded me of life. I sat stationary, and buried my head under a recording of a person with nothing left. I held my heart, staring out at the dark that I wanted to escape in. A length that no person dared, but a low that felt necessary. I felt an unnecessary realism flow through me, as my arms folded, feeling a coldness drip down my neck. I got up, and went to the porch of attempting life again. A moon vanished above me, showing a pine away from me only just by some measurements. The bicycle appeared broken on the road, as I walked to what I remember being the last resort in this world. I walked to a reused bench, and stared out at the murky waters that felt like memories. I looked to my left, seeing a young boy sitting in the back of a delinquent’s wagon, and to my right a child amongst a smaller group, enjoying the finer delicacies of life. In between it all, a fool. I cracked my bubbly back, as a soreness hit my veins. I stood slowly, my body tossing and turning inside. The world turned askew, as the sun beat slowly onto my flustered body. I took flight across the ramp of a broken dream, taking a flip that would ruin me for a day. A nostalgia for the life that was simple broke me down slowly, as I felt my walking slow down. I sat by a curb, watching a teenager go away from a regretful sunset on a bench. He sported a terrible frown, forgetting of the one. A light flew by at",Does the poster suffer from depression?,yes

"Im a mess and I need to rant. Every so often, I'll find a glimmer of hope and try my hardest to change my life. I'll start exercising and eating healthy, and pushing myself to talk to people, and I'll actually feel pretty good for a few days. Then I just stop. I'll wake up one day and and have absolutely no desire to be healthy anymore and slip right back into feeling like shit and hating myself because I can't commit to the simplest of things. This is probably the fourth time it's happened in the past year. I made some really bad choices today regarding food, which made me feel so much worse because in my eyes, my worth as a human being is directly tied to the shape of my body. Nobody could ever convince me that it's not. This past bought of motivation, I tried to convince myself that I was going to exercise and eat right for the sake of my health, but in the back of my mind, I knew the only real reason was because I wanted to lose weight. And now here I am, completely abandoned diet and exercise and right back into the throws of depression. All I want to do anymore is lay in bed and try to fall asleep. I don't have a job (or the desire to have one) and I lost most of my friends because I never talked to them. I live with my mom who I thought I could talk to about anything, but I feel like I can't tell her about how bad it's gotten. It doesn't help that she tells me everyday that I need to get a job. I know she is right, but it makes me feel like an even bigger piece of garbage because I've never held down a job for more than 4 months. If I got a job right now, I'd probably have a breakdown and quit the first week. I went through cosmetology school and put myself into debt just to wind up hating the field and trying to lie to myself that I didn't. I thought it was all about doing hair, but it turns out it's all about trying to get people to buy some shitty hair product. I know my outlook on the world is fucked up, but I don't know how to change myself. It's like all these negative thoughts are engraved in the back of my skull. I just feel like I'm stuck and any move I make is the wrong one.

"Struggled with depression and anxiety for 3 years and made it through Hi everyone, I just wanted to share my experiences with depression and anxiety in the hope it might give someone else a reason to keep going. I’m new to reddit, so I hope this is okay! I’ve struggled with severe depression and anxiety for the past three years and it’s honestly been the most difficult thing I’ve ever dealt with. Mental illness is silently crippling. I’ve spent more nights than I can remember wracked with sobs, feeling incredibly alone, and fantasizing about suicide. I’ve spent more days than I can remember feeling hollow, being apathetic, and not caring about what happened to me. Depression is a fucking bitch, and even now, when I actually feel happy and loved and excited for my future, I’m not naive enough to think that I’ll never have to struggle with my mental health again. But I think I have learned how to best cope with it. Medication didn’t work for me, and while I do believe that professional therapy can be invaluable to people struggling with mental illness, it didn’t make a big difference in my case. But I learned to focus on the present, to rely on loved ones I’m lucky enough to have, and to forgive myself. Take it one small step at a time. So what if you couldn’t leave your room today? That shit’s fucking hard! You got up and you got out of bed, that’s the first step. Learn to love yourself even through the despair and self-loathing. There is no one path to overcoming depression, and sometimes it’s not exactly the cure-all you envisioned but rather learning to live with it. But I promise you all that one day, it will be better. You will be happy again. And until then, I’m happy to listen to you if you ever need anyone to talk to or have any questions.",Does the poster suffer from depression?,yes
"Sick of rejection Met someone on an app we seemed to click and talked all night till like 4am, same the next night and the night after that etc. Honestly for the first time in ages I thought Id done it and found someone who liked me aswell and we could hang out and have some fun, even just over the summer Id have been happy with that. After more talking we met, we drove round and spent a few hours just chilling and talking it was fun but something wasnt right. I have these little games I play to kind of 'test the waters', nothing creepy just some fun light flirting like a play full punch to the arm or lean myself a bit closer in watching a video or something, harmless stuff but the reactions tell you the story. Long story short it wasnt the story I was hoping for, nothing was reciprocated and there was just no positive body language (I know im sounding like some sort of socially awkward overly analytical weirdo here but trust me its just the best way I can describe it over text). So it gets to nearly 11 he starts yawning talking about being up for work, fair enough weve been out 4 hours so I drop him home, says text me when you get back so I do and sure enough the generic one word 'haha' responses start and that was it. The thing is its not the first time, it happens all the time, I rarely find anyone who actually has proper chat with me (always just 'fuck now dude?' or that type of crap) so I start getting feelings and they seem to like me, we meet and it all seems to fall apart aftwerwards. Your just gonna have to trust me that im not creepy, I dont make sexual advances, I can hold convo, make people laugh, everyone always seems happy to spend a good few hours with me and not want to go home yet when they do it all comes crashing down.

"Looking for an opinion So I have been angry for awhile now, and I feel like my anger is unjustified. A few weeks, I told one of my close friends that I had feelings for her, and I also told her I wanted some space to get over these feelings. This is because I couldn't be with her. She has a significant other. Soon after, she wouldn't talk to me at all, and she avoided me. All of her friends told me that I shouldn't have done that because it was a bad thing to do. I just wanted to tell her that I wanted some space from her, so I could no longer have feelings for her. Since then, all of her friends, have treated me with aggression and insults. I get dismissed every time I'm around her and all of her friends. This has launched me into another Depressive episode. I was yelled at by other people and ostracized. I was thinking that what I did wasn't so bad, but maybe I'm wrong. I feel like a bad person.

All from 3 different marriages not including my parents’ since I’m their only child. And I’m not close with any of them. I️ don’t even know all of their ages. I️ didn’t have mother figure in my life because my stepmoms were just either physically abusive or emotionally. My dad was a drunk, and just controlled every aspect of my life yelling at me if I️ didn’t want to do something or had different opinions than him “you think you’re in control of your life but you’re not.

Then in November, I saw B at Target with someone she hated (lets call her E) at the time (B still does). What pissed me off that B fucking cat-fished E the same week. Again, made up 2 weeks later. She’s probably the only friend that actually asks to hang out with me (I have other friends btw). B likes to play these ditching pranks when I would leave then B and her other friends would leave me. She’s also destroyed my stuff after I told her no. One of my other friends (let’s call her A) told me that she was obsessed with me that every time when hanging out with B, B would mention me and it creeps me out. I don’t know how to deal with the friendship since I’m scared to deal with B. Any advice? TLDR: My friend is toxic and obsessed with me. I don’t know how to break it off without hurting her feelings?",Does the poster suffer from depression?,yes
"Went through tough times, friends weren't there, but I still want them in my life. I have 2 best friends from high school since we were young. Long story short, we were the best of friends, had a great friendship and were really good to each other. We are all 19 now, and I went through a bad time the end of last year, my brother was shot in the shoulder as a accident at work, and had alot of issues with my childhood come up. The only difference with my friends and I is that I grew up in a completely different way then they did , I was raised in foster care, that was tough, I grew up poor and had many bad things happen during that time, on the other hand they had very loving parents and a great home. They dont seem to understand some of those things and find it hard to understand why I am the way I am sometimes I need my space and need to be by myself, Being in a foster care that had terrible people in it, I never had celebrated birthdays since a young age, like 3 and when i was 15 was when I found out that they are special days , and so when birthdays do happen I may come across as blunt? Or dont make a massive deal out of it for them sometimes, and they take all of that as I am being blunt and they seem to move away from me and dont make plans with me, same as when my brother was shot, I was a mess, initially they were there for me but eventually they drifted off. But as always we came back together and were just like old times, I know and they know Im a person who likes to deal with things on my own, but I just feel like a burden in their perfect world. I feel like their parents dont like me because of my family history and the way I grew up, I just dont want to always feel like a burden on my friends.",Does the poster suffer from depression?,yes
"How can I get out of an almost constant state of dissociation? A majority of the time I’m just in a state of dissociation. It’s difficult for me to describe, but it’s like I’m just not mentally there. It’s like a constant state of autopilot. I’m there but my mind isn’t. My mind is always so foggy and difficult to navigate through. Most of the time, I’m just mentally empty. I used to never be like this but I can’t remember what life was even like before this.

"In an awkward situation with my best friend. She wants me to tell how I feel towards her - how should I? I’ve been friends with her for 3 years. She’s a lovely person and I really like her, but there were some occasions where I felt weird around her. She apparently sensed it and recently asked me what’s wrong between us, telling I should tell her if there’s something. Some of the things I’m thinking of telling her are: - she often kind of invites herself when she learns I hang out with my friends and invites other people (that I don’t know well) as well without asking me when I organise something (picnic, trip etc.) - she’s a nice person and means well, but she sometimes says things that hurt my feelings. For example, she said she couldn’t wait to move into a new flat with her bf or how he’s like in bed when I was having a difficult time after a breakup, and she often assumes I’m broke and I feel sort of belittled. - she tells my rather personal stuff to her other friends, like gossip I could list several things, but I’m not sure if I should be upfront, as she has social anxieties and I don’t want her to feel bad or scared in social situations. Or are there nicer ways to put them? Also, I should probably mention that I have a small circle of friends, and she’s basically been my only friend that I get to see regularly, I’ve been really good friends with a girl (B) that I met partly through her for the past few months. I enjoy hanging out with her (A), and we text each other all the time, but I’m not sure how she (A) feels about this. Thanks for taking your time to read this, I appreciate it.

"Stop and think for a moment It's like stumbling around in the darkness. You can't see, you can only feel. Blinded by the pain of reality. You beg it to stop, as the throbbing in your heart grows stronger. But it's not gonna stop, no matter how hard you beg. Your so called 'friends' abandon You, because your depression talk has gotten too dark. But what's the worst part? That you can't control it? That you can't stop it? Maybe it's the fact that just maybe... just maybe you don't want It to stop. You cling onto your pain, because after all..it's familiar. It's been with you for a while. You stand upon the dark edge, upon the highest edge you could find. You feel the wind blow in your face. You freeze. All the good moments, All the good people. It all comes in floods of part nostalgy and part regret. What took you to this edge? What made you so desperate, To take such drastic action?

"My parents’ living room is not large enough... My sister and I are visiting our parents this weekend - celebrating a family holiday. Overall it’s been a lot of fun, but this evening, there is a particular tv show that my sister and mom wanted to watch. Sister begged to get the “comfortable chair”. Mom and dad are sitting in their respective chairs. My choices are the folding chair or the floor. Also, sister’s devices are taking up the only proximate outlet, and I only have 10% on my phone battery. I am exhausted - it’s been a fun weekend but there was a lot of planning and I haven’t had much sleep. I’d really prefer to go upstairs to the bedrooms. My mom really wants me to sit with them... but I’m just too exhausted. I don’t want to spend an hour and a half on a folding chair OR on the floor. I don’t want to watch this TV show - they can watch it but I’m just not interested. I especially don’t want to spend an hour and a half in an uncomfortable chair, watching a TV show I don’t care about, with a dead phone battery. So I’m in the kitchen right now, with my phone plugged into an outlet. Debating how angry my family will get if I go upstairs and lay down. Debating if I even have enough energy to stay awake for another hour and a half. This is a small thing compared to most of the posts on this board.

I hate forcing myself to do the most simple things, like: taking a shower, putting on makeup, cooking, cleaning, even playing videogames. I'm a huge WoW nerd, so I should be excited for the new patch and game. But, I'm not. I got amped up when I saw the trailer, but now, I rather not play it. I rather not play anything.

"Should I have kids? Here’s why I’m asking: My mother has an undiagnosed mental illness, of that I am certain. My best guess is either bipolar or borderline personality disorder. Growing up with her was difficult and she never got the help she needed. My brother and I suffered greatly as a result. The scariest thing is when I occasionally find, or think I find, her mental illness in myself.. certain tendencies to obsess, feel abandonment that isn’t real and lashing out because of it, etc. When that happens I just feel so disgusting and shameful. In those moments I wish that she wasn’t my mom and that I wasn’t her son, or that I could permanently swap heads with someone else. I think about all this as my fiancé and I talk about having kids. Both of us are ready and we want to be parents so very badly, though I haven’t brought up my fears to her. I worry often about passing on that illness to our children. My fiancé doesn’t deserve that, she shouldn’t have to face those hard challenges. I love her so much and the thought of doing that to her kills me inside. I feel so much shame around wanting to be a parent because of this that I wonder if I should be one at all, or rather, a biological one.

"FIL &amp; BIL literally make themselves at home when they visit I like my home to look nice when guests come over. Sometimes I’ll have a lightly scented candle on in the bathroom or hallway or I’ll turn on a lamp to light up my entryway. The kitchen is always set buffet style to make it easy for everyone to serve themselves. I always make sure to make my guest bedroom is welcoming. Like fluffy pillows, comfy comforter, extra linens, working tv. You get the idea. Whenever my FIL comes to visit it irks TF out of me when he makes these little adjustments while he’s here. I recently noticed that he’ll blow out the candle in the bathroom. Like WTF?! I know this cause I went in there before and after him once. He’ll also just randomly walk over to turn off my hallway lamp when he’s only been here for like 20 minutes. A few years ago, when he lived with us for a minute he rearranged my guest bedroom AND would rearrange everything around in my kitchen! I’m like wtf, I like my keurig right where it is! Thank you! Another wtf, we have a sectional that sits about 7-8 people comfortably when FIL/Bro IL come over they insist on spreading out and lay across the whole damn thing. Do they offer me a seat when I come over? No. It’s only until my bf scoots over to make room for me so I can squeeze in to sit somewhere at the end of the couch. Oh and bro in law? He always makes sure we know he eats gluten free. FYI he is NOT allergic to gluten and insists that “If the package doesn’t say Gluten Free it’s not gluten free.” Everyone knows not to start that argument with him, there’s no point. Even if I mention that if my friend who has celiac disease can eat something it’s gluten free. He just shakes his head like idk what I’m talking about.

Had he sent me a normal text today, I would have answered. Instead, he sent a passive-aggressive “Ever since you’re feeling better, you never bother to call me.” This is simply NOT true. I have called him many times when he said he needed to talk, even though I hate talking on the phone. I just simply can’t take this level of neediness.
