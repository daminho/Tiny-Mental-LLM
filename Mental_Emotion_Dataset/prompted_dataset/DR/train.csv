"How to avoid a relapse? I've been having a particularly rough year; I attempted suicide, the love of my life left me, I failed my year at university, I've been physically assaulted, I've been sexually assaulted and today my grandfather died. I feel like I'm running on empty and doing the bare minimum to survive for myself while trying to be a rock to others. My emotional resilience has been wiped out. I feel ""okay"" but I've felt like this in the past and it has turned out that I've just been lying to myself and making things worse. Any advice on how to manage/process my emotions? Or just how to better understand myself?

"This is how I feel and I have a slight sense I am the only one to think think this way. I am depressed? Help wanted I yearn for the days I was in high school. I felt as if I was always happy and never worried about anything. I am 22, just having graduated from University. It seems each day I am becoming a person who does not want to have a relationship with anyone other then my family. I want to be alone. Happiness to me is being sheltered by reality--alone with my thoughts. I deleted every single bit of social media I had about a year ago (SC, FB, Insta, Twitter, etc) in an attempt to become as alone as possible. I truly deep down wish I was never born, but I would never ever commit suicide. I wish more then anything else that I can just disappear and leave this world. I am studying for the MCAT currently. I don't have any problem doing so because of my extremely addictive personality, but I find that I enjoy things that take my mind off of reality. Studying, reading, listening to music or going for a drives are my favorite ways to achieve this. But the reality I see is that this world is shit. I believe that as a whole, humans are riddled with greed and selfishness that are the motivations behind MOST of everything in this world. And by humans, that obviously includes myself and I hate myself down to the core for the selfish things I have done. Maybe I am too cynical or something. But this bad world syndrome fucks my brain and idk. I REEEEALLLLY question every aspect of life and I can't help it. Each time I am left with questions that completely make me hate the way this world is. I guess I can give one example. The most recent self-philosophical argument I had is the idea of wars, with murdering others specifically. We praise those who fight for our country, yet at the same time a great deal of these same people are super religious. Do people not evaluate the reality they are in? Do they not question why they believe the things they do? Am I the only one? Does someone's act of ending another life provide justification for doing the same? Who is to even say so? If they would kill all of us if we did not kill them, then what makes our lives worth more? That's just one example, but then I look at areas like American healthcare or the fact my family and others are wealthy while there are people fucking dying because they cannot get water or food. Even the American political system with the deep state and shit. Why are we even on this damn earth? Seriously, what is the point of everything in life? I simply don't view the joys of life being worth living for. I just don't understand. This whole text here is just me rambling my thoughts in hopes that someone somewhere reading this could maybe help me.

"Advice for getting back in touch with everyday life? I think the hardest thing for me, and the largest factor I need to address to try and feel healthy again, is simply trying to feel engaged in and enjoying the present. Right now, days have little to no meaning at all, and I am only really able to think of my life in terms of weeks, months, and years. As a result of that, I feel nothing from the hobbies or moments that would before provide me feelings of joy, satisfaction or just generally fulfilling myself. The only activities I really ""enjoy"" anymore is anything that provides me with a complete escape from reality, however these activities are not exactly one belonging to a healthy lifestyle. I just want to enjoy the things that I used to enjoy, but whenever I try I feel like I am wasting my time, are not doing them well enough. Has anybody gone through something similar, and has advice for how they managed to get through it? Thanks for reading.

"Having a really bad stretch of days.. Hi all, I know this sub moves kinda fast but I just wanted to vent, hopefully some of you read this.. So my story is that I've had depression and social anxiety for about 15 years or so (at least that's when I recall starting to feel ""off"".. I'm 29 now).. Because of my poor decision to bottle things up and accept that I'm unhappy I put off seeking help until about a month or two ago in which I started going to therapy. It had taken a rather bad mental fallout that occurred in early December for me to finally reach out for help. In my sessions we've been working on techniques to combat both my SA and depression, these include going to places alone such as coffee shops, yoga classes, shopping malls, etc. (Keep in mind I have ""functioning"" social anxiety where I can physically be around people but I'm extremely uncomfortable the entire time and have a very difficult time interacting with people).. The thought process being that my depression stems from loneliness and my SA contributes to that.. It's been a big step for me to try and go out on my own, but I've been doing it almost every day even though it doesn't seem to be creating any improvement. Unfortunately the last few days have been incredibly difficult, I'm getting a very sick feeling of hopelessness and worry that my life is now just constantly shuffling around desperately trying to find something in the world that will ""fix"" me. I tried to sit at home last night to give myself a break and I couldn't even do that, I started becoming consumed by those bad thoughts and began having a panic attack.. So I decided to just go drive aimlessly even though we were in the middle of a snow storm.. I feel miserable again today and I'm just running out of steam to keep going, I really don't know what to do anymore.. I'm exhausted from constantly forcing myself into uncomfortable public situations but at the same time my home feels like a prison.. I have nobody to talk to or gain support from anymore, the couple of friends that I have all have their own lives with wives and kids and my family has been out of my life for 10 years and for good reason.. I know nobody has answers as to what I should do but I just needed to rant

"I dont understand how people can be so interested in so many things First, let me apologize for formatting issues, I am typing this on mobile. I generally find television boring, have little to no interest in Netflix shows, anime, and most video games and hobbies. I really only have one hobby that I have feel attachment to, and frankly, I dont enjoy most new shows. If I watch something of my own, its typically something I watched from when I was younger, like scooby doo or Phineas and ferb as the two main ones, being my absolute favorites from my youth, though that's rare as it is. And whenever I do those things, except for my one main hobby sometimes, I feel that I am all to aware that it's just escapism, and instead of escaping, I fall back into the same track. I don't think I have a short attention span, but that's what I always feel like I go back to in the back of my head, as that's what people my age are supposed to have because of this digital age.

"Will I ever be with somebody? I'm so lonely. I'm 19 and I don't have a clue what a relationship feels like. All my friends are talking about marriage and I've never even had a real kiss I cared about. I didn't think I was that bad, I guess I was wrong. I know there are people who go much longer without finding anyone special but I really hope that doesn't happen to me. I've spent so long being someone I'm not, and now I don't know how to actually be myself anymore. I feel so depersonalized and isolated. I need someone to tell me it's ok. I have so many deep problems and I cant talk about them. I don't want sex, I want someone who can hold me and reassure me that I don't need to die to feel at peace. I just want to cuddle and talk, is that too much to ask?? I don't even care who, man woman other I dont care and still I cant fucking find anyone. I can't even find real friends. I give up, it's probably too late for me anyway. Alcohol is the only thing I have a real relationship with.

"Anxiety and Depression make you contradict and lose yourself I've had enough. I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for months and the whole situation is fucking my mind up. I know I should face my problems but I don't want to and that amplifies my anxiety. I just wish people ignored me and yet I feel lonely. I don't want to be hurt and yet I am the one hurting myself. There is so many things I'd like to do but in the end I end up wasting time on the bed. There is many things I want and yet I can't bring myself to work and get them.

"How much longer can I fake it? I'm 33, had a full-time job for several years and have a young son. I took a leave from work in 2014 for mental illness, at which point I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder, prescribed Zoloft and was back at work when my short term disability ran out. This was the first time I'd been on anti-depressants. I felt tired all the time, had no sex drive, and started gaining weight, but at least I was functional. Over the next year, I received a few verbal warnings and 1 written warning at work about my poor performance. Eventually, the mask broke and I was on leave again in 2015. This time I was away for much longer, was diagnosed w/ dysthymia, tried several different medications, found out that just about every SSRI gave me horrible side effects (sweating, nausea, insomnia, no sex drive, I'm actually thinking now that maybe they caused serotonin syndrome) and eventually landed on Remeron and Wellbutrin. This combo actually started to work, without any side effects (except for weight gain, which I've been managing with a diet now). This time, I returned to work because I received notice in the mail that my employment was going to be terminated because it was coming up on 2 years without being at work. I figured if I was going to be fired for not returning, I may as well return, make some money and worst thing that happens is I get fired anyways. I was not better when I returned to work, I was functional, I was able to smile, but the low mood persisted in a big way. And so here I am, still working, trying to fake it everyday, feeling like a house of cards thats ready to topple. I'm afraid because if I go off work again that will have been 3 leaves of absence, and I really don't think I could show my face around here anymore after that. I remember how horrible my life felt when I was on medical leave. I remember falling behind on child support, having to borrow money from my parents. I remember trying to convince my girlfriend that my low sex drive was because of meds and not because of her. I remember trying to convince an insurance company that I'm sick, while simultaneously trying to convince myself that I can get better. I remember feeling like a useless waste of skin that drained on the resources of everyone that dared to care about me. I guess what I'm saying is I know, right now, I'm suffering from depression, and I'm afraid of what might happen if I admit that again.

"I feel like the friendship I have is fake on her behalf I have known this girl for going on 7 years. I am not the type of person that has many friends, or is very sociable. I try to keep to myself and mind my own business, and donât care to hag out with people. We met at work, and I liked that there was so much that we had in common, almost like I could see myself in her. We became friends. However, there has been a few instances that make me question her friendship. We are both waitresses, and she would ask me how my night was and how much I made. It made me feel a bit uncomfortable, because the way she asked seemed a bit odd. If I would make more than her she would seem a little upset, if she made more, she seemed to be happy. Even now when I make more than her she says âI hate youâ. She says Iâm her âbest friendâ and gets mad if I hang out with someone else without her knowing, tag/get tagged by other people on FB, or go places without inviting her. Although, she does all of these things as well, but I donât get upset or mention them. When we started working at a different restaurant, right off the bat, there were people that didnât like me. These are people that are problematic, and always cause drama (which I cannot tolerate). Well, my friend knowing that these people talked behind my back, hated me, and made up rumors about me, decided to invite on them to her house! At that moment I realized that this fakeness was not just in my mind! My friend likes a lot of attention, she gets upset when she doesnât get it, or when I do; my friend likes to judge other peopleâs bodyâs (sheâs taller 5â6â, thin); my friend sees every imperfection in others; My friend expects me to invite her out, buy her treats, bring her things to work, but she has never offered to do the same for me (although she does it for others); my friend posted 5 emojis on my fb wall on my birthday (ðð ðð­ð) I always congratulate her and wish her well; My friend calls me her âbestieâ..... how real is this friendship for her?? I forgot to mention that I always try to give her Christmas/birthday presents according to what she likes(mostly earrings or pretty blouses/dresses), she rarely gives me gifts (which is fine, I donât expect anything in return) but when she does, itâs something that has nothing to do with me (like a size large red and blue Superman-logo hoodie. Iâm a size small) or a random item she finds in the clearance section...

"Does anyone else's depression causes them to constantly daydream or imagine their lives are a documentary? I daydream a lot about people I know in real life or situations I wish would happen. It's alternate reality I go to escape my loneliness. I sometimes daydream about being in a hotel in some tropical paradise or being in a very romantic date or just that I'm in some kind of reality TV show/documentary where I'm the star and the narrator at the same time and everyone admires me. My mental state worsens once the daydreaming is over and I realize it's just fantasy. :/

"Iâm afraid of my family falling apart after my grandfather passes away I need advice. My mother passed away from cancer 4 years ago now. I have two brothers in their 20s. One hasnât finished his associates and the other in nursing school but takes every chance he can get to get away from helping the family. My father is an irresponsible alcoholic who thinks itâs beneath him to wash even his own dishes. I currently live in San Francisco and trying to get into medical school and making up for my precious failures in college. My grandfather is the patriarch of the family. He always has been and has been the glue to keeping it together.

"exhausted this is my first time posting on this subreddit but I need something to regurgitate everything that Iâm feeling as it may be the only thing that stops me from trying to hurt myself. Iâve only slept for about 2 hours and I have to be up for work in 30 minutes which is making me feel worse. As my depression has gotten worse, I find myself sinking further into a place where I have no desire to help or look after myself. I still live at home with my parents and since my mom is aware of my attempts to hurt myself, she has taken on a lot of the responsibilities that I once had for myself. Like cooking for me, cleaning for me, taking me to work sometimes, sleeping in my bed with me. I feel so fucking bad about that, I feel bad for her and I feel bad that sheâs really the only person. I have my boyfriend who has been as supportive as he can be, especially because heâs dealing with his own obstacles and I feel like Iâm incapable of being there for him. I keep having thoughts of breaking up with him and becoming so sensitive towards everything he says and it makes me beyond words angry at myself that I have failed him and our relationship. I canât make me happy, I canât make him happy and I wonât make anyone happy ever. I am attention and reassurance seeking, I get so angry at the successes of others because Iâm not good enough. My identity is shattered and especially because now all I can think about is how sad I am. If Iâm on this downward spiral now, will I ever get out of it?? If I have to live with this any longer, I really donât want to live anymore. Everyday I entertain the idea of being in a car accident because I want people to take care of me and love me but I also hate that I want that and wish so badly to be okay with not needing validation and approval from others. I attempted to overdose recently and all I thought about was someone finding me dead on the floor and hoping they would feel bad. I couldnât even think of how this would affect my poor mother who has been through so much with my ungrateful attenuation seeking ass. Im so grossed out with myself. Iâm eating at myself and letting myself go, I keep picking and scratching and slapping myself because I donât think I deserve to get better. I deserve to hurt because Iâm a sad sack of shit who has NOTHING to be sad about. I have everything I could ever need in life and Iâm still complaining like an ingrate. I fucking hate myself so much, there is someone out there who deserves my own life more than I do. Iâm going to start antidepressants I was prescribed re cently and am in therapy (I donât go as often as I probably should) and while that is good, Iâm almost scared of getting better just to get worse again. Iâm scared of going on antidepressants because Iâd rather feel so much than feel nothing at all which is my predicament. If this doesnât work, if I keep waking up depressed and if I continue to get worse, I really want to just die. I have no friends, they all live far away and I think they only care because I think they can tell Iâm depressed based on some statuses Iâve posted. My boyfriend continues to be loving towards me, but I always feel like he only does now because he doesnât want to hurt me. He says he wants me to get better and be more confident, and I canât help but feel that maybe he deserves someone who is more confident. He reminisces on the past and is always talking about wanting to travel and I canât help but feel so bad thinking that I wonât be involved in those plans because Iâm not a fun person to be around. People have reassured me that I am more than enough but Iâm not, Iâm not I donât believe them. Theyâre just saying that I hate myself so much

"Thinking of quiting my job I work as a waitress and it's killing me inside. I have anxiety along with depression and having to answer phones, greet customers, small talk etc is just exhausting for me. I also don't get along with some people there. My boss and the chef mainly. I get really anxious the entire day beforehand (work evenings) and it just puts me in a bad spot. Another reason for wanting to quit is I'm currently a student and I'm in the last leg of my final year dissertation, I just don't want the stress of having to go deal with my boss and having to take orders etc when I have this important deadline coming up. The only problem is it's my only income. I don't want my boyfriend getting mad at me because he has to support me with his shitty job for a couple of months untill my project is over and I can find a better job.

"Failure to trust ââthose on my sideââ. [possible trigger Warning] I find myself incapable of trusting my spouse. Iâve been with my SO for nearly 15 years, 7 married this year, we have 3 children. Before I hit my mid-teens Iâd been through nearly a decade of sexual abuse within the already dysfunctional household I grew up one, with an alcoholic father and a narcissistic mother. I met my now spouse when I was 17. He had been in a two year relationship with a girl a few years his senior, which left him broken after her infidelity. And Iâ¦ well I lived day to day, carrying what I could. Iâll never forgot how I coldly and factually told him with a mere two sentences what I had to endure, telling him that if he did chose me, he would be settling for a lifetime shared with a woman with severe ups and downs due to her limited mental strength. He convinced me to go for it and I wept in his arms. That was probably the first time in my life someone did not look the other way and I allowed myself to be vulnerable, instead of distant and cold. I opened myself up to him. Few years later my home situation imploded. I ran. His mother took me under her wing, I think she was the first parental figure I could lean on in my life. His father loathed me as the girl from the slums, threatening me in private to never marry his son. Reminding me of my lowly descent when he could. He would never come to accept me fully but at least fully respects me in public, which to me is commendable enough. Afterwards I started living with my now SO, still during our teens in a studio. The idea was triggered and pushed for by me as a solution after a bout of infidelity on his side after he moved to study in a city a couple hours away. He partook in intimate relations with a girl he knew from another country over webcam due to ââlonelinessââ and held the act in the same regards as watching porn whereas I didnât. We tried to work things out. As we did my view of him started to crumble, but was rebuilt after living together surprisingly worked remarkably well. We grew more towards each other and were best friends on top of lovers. In between this life changing chapter and where I am now, he has had a few strikes I simply can not forget. While I was once open to share my ups and downs and sadness with him, now Iâd rather not. Because where I once trusted him to hold me, I now trust him to ridicule me and tell me to man the fuck up. And the stubborn ass I am, I do, but this comes with resentment. But to explain the strikes: - One is where I was crying after having particularly bad and involuntary memories. Annoyed by my state and stressed by upcoming finals he asked me: When is this going to end? Youâre always spinning the same old tales, youâre driving yourself insane. - Another was when he screamed out while we had visitors: How would you like it if I told everyone you were raped? He believed I had done something utterly despicable, blame was pinned upon me by one of his siblings. In that moment something broke, the attack was 100% unwarranted. So much trust lost. When he figured out I had done nothing to him the apologies came swift and numerous. - One was when I asked him for a letter. He will always buy flowers on special occasions, which I hate. They wither and die. I just hate the sentiment, I dislike it and I have communicated this. I wanted something which lasts. A reminder. All I wanted was a letter. Years I secretly yearned for one but received flowers instead, which I still tended to. Finallyâ¦ I asked for a letter. He refused and told me point blank to my face he would not. That it was silly I needed something to hold onto, and that this item would become something of an unhealthy obsession. - The latest strike was after I endured a panic attack while I was on my own, which I managed myself before he returned home. He was upset when I confided in him and he stated: I will not be on your side if you are mentally ill. I will choose our children and make sure they grow up with stability. (Later he corrected himself and stated that if I was to turn schizophrenic or manic, he would have me committed and divorce me, but would support me through depression and anxiety). Now to me a panic attack is something manageable if you are equipped to deal with it. Through the years I have learned to be aware of my surroundings and triggers and to be prepared to deal with anything since I am responsible for my children. I have no history of hysterical or erratic behavior, so I found his reaction to my first ever panic attack veryâ¦ crude. I have my pride even through my depression for what I have survived and what I have accomplished. But I hate that I can not find it in myself again to open up towards my spouse and more than often find myself crying when I am capable to, so I can put up my smile and brave face when I NEED to. Iâve successfully faked it till I made it. And of the 15 years that we have been together the good by far outweighs the bad, something which can not be conveyed well enough in this post. But what has been said can be never taken back. Even though recently he said: Don't you understand after 15 years I am on your side? I

"Alcoholic dad It's been like this since I was 6 years old. Just to give information, my family and I lived on a farm before I was six and I rarely got into contact with people outside of my family so I barely knew how to talk and would rather screech and be mad all the time and this led me to be very bad at my own language and have few ""real"" friends. My dad's problem started when he started drinking after the company he worked in shutdown I didn't know about it but my family fought about it without my knowing and I don't even know my siblings that well due to me never having gotten any real attention I just sat in my room while they fought at age six and played a game of Madagascar and shut it out I started understanding at age 10 how bad I was with actual relationships i barely know even now how to initiate discussions with other people or relatives and cryed, everyone started to fight at age 11 now at age 16 my dad drove me and my friend from my other friends due to us having had a LAN (played games) and he almost drove right into the railing of a bridge and that was today now that it wasn't just me who was endangered because of his fucking problem I started getting mad. He barely cares what I say and what my mom says he probably wants to leave my mom but doesn't have the financial expertise or job to do so. I dont know what to do and I barely have the guts to cut myself or anything just banging my head into a wall when my parents aren't home or watching people play games. If you read this whole thing thank you. My dad had gotten physical a few times as well. Sorry for the wall of text.

"My mom mocks my depression to her friends My mom doesnât believe Iâm depressed even though all the psychologists Iâve been to so far tell her I am - and i KNOW myself that feeling like I want to kill myself all the time isnât a healthy mindset. Iâve tried to off myself a few times to no avail (without her knowing) and narrowly escaped inpatient. She calls me lazy and ungrateful, complains about how I donât do anything productive and sit around all day, I donât eat much if anything. She treats me so awfully and if I retaliate in the same way all of a sudden Iâm the bad person. And hereâs the worst of it: I heard her talking about me to her friend, laughing and mocking me, saying stuff like âoh everything is always wrong for her, poor girl! she says shes depressed but i know sheâs making it up for attention so she doesnt have to do work around the house like the lazy bitch she isâ It crushes me even further and at this point I donât know what to do. I want to kill myself but I have so many goals and aspirations for the future. Iâm stuck in this position between so badly wanting to live and so badly wanting to die.

"Thoughest time of my life, and honestly i cant show it So i meet this girl for nearly 2 years ago. I'd say we are probably more then best friends, we are soul friends. For over a year we talked about me moving to their town, so i can get closer to her, her husband and her kids. We have literally been talking for nearly 2 years straight. I understand that she is getting abit tired of me now, but i just moved 1 week ago and she has bearly talked to me once. She is so busy playing video games right now, the only one that really has helped me this past week is her husband. I feel i moved so far for nothing, and now its KILLING me. and since i wont have internet for a while, im getting bored out of my mind, and my depression is hitting me so hard.. I did confront her about this though, but she keeps saying she is depressed and the only way for her is to play games. Even tho when i play games, she keeps going to private worlds with friends, and whenever i as for an invite, she ignores it, even tho it pops up a big icon on her face. My life has been so hard lately, my mom lost her kids in court, other then that, my stepdad made an false accusation of me doing stuff to a child becasuse he is a fucking moron and wanted to ruin my life for fun. (And no, i didnt do anything to a kid just FYI). I won the case but it was ever lasting 3 years.. Other thatn that ive been bullied for 15 years, i've lived alone for since i was 16. Aswell im a very VERY jelous guy, so im not gonna deny that, and here is one of the issues with this: MY EX fucked my life up with cheating on me, and since then i have big trust issues, aswell i tend to get very jelous now when my best friend is getting new friends and seems to have more fun with them then me. Tho, i know my best friend would never leave me since she wanted me up here anyway, but the jelousy that she is having such a good time with others are ripping my life apart. The past 5 Months has been depression only, and Honestly if people has gone through as much as me these past 5 months with suicidal thought every day, they would of gone mental. I have a very strong mind, so it takes alot to take me down mentally, but for some reason, im lost and i dont know what to do. Half of the time i just wanna sit and cry. Before i was friend with her, i had a depression but it wasnt that bad. I didnt have friends then so i didnt have to go through what i have now, For some reason i feel like im not designed to have friends, that my life should keep going on the PC without real ""friends""

"Girlfriend attempted to break her arm to avoid going to work My girlfriend began her summer job in a hospital earlier this summer where she mostly cleans and prepares meals for the patients. She has been pretty upfront about the fact that she is stressed during the days and doesn't want to go to work most days. Since we don't live together we see eachother about three times per week although less during summer since work prohibits that to an extent. She has never during our two year long relationship showed any signs of self harm nor depression. However, today i saw her for the first time this week and I noticed bruises on her fore arm. She unwillingly explained that she had tried to break her arm in order to not have to go to work anymore for the rest of the summer. She said that she had had a panic attack and in desperation smashed her arm into a metal pole in order to break her arm. She promised to let me know if she felt that way again but I am not sure if she is going to. She also made me promise to not tell anyone about it. How can I help prevent her from harming herself another time? What other things are there that I should be aware of concerning her well being? I hope this is the proper sub for this and I would be very thankful for your advice.

"Law of Attraction is bullshit. Also hard work doesn't pay off. Everything in life is based on chance and luck only. Our society preaches the fiction of hard work paying off because we need most expandable people to work hard, so that the rest can just chill and live off their backs. Also every fucking motivational coach and self-help guide is a fucking scam. Focusing your goals, working hard and putting effort in to achieve them? Yeah, tell that to people with terminal diseases or people living in poverty without the chance to ever get better, people dying of famine or living in war zones. Tell that to the legions of people who didn't make the cut and never will. Yeah, tell them they just ""didn't work hard enough"", ""didn't want it enough"" while you completely ignore how fucking lucky you got to be in the privileged position you are in.

"Friend Abandonment Issues Hey Reddit. Im having some friend issues. I(M33) have a friend(M34) who I was close with for years who now seems to abandoning me. We met each other 10 years ago. We hit it off and would casually hang out with eachother. He was new to the city so I ushered him into the fold of my friend group.We both had similar tastes and sense of humor. It would work out good and we would have a great time. After a couple years he totally cut off contact with me and those friends. I was confused but didn't mind so much then because I wasn't super close with him. I was confused but not hurt. A couple years after that I reached out to a bunch of people because I needed help moving. I was pretty desperate and couldn't afford movers so I reached out to him as well. To my surprise he responded and came and helped. I was so happy he offered to help and was happy to see him again. After that, we started hanging out again. I asked him what happened and why he broke off contact and he shared with me things about being depressed and hanging out with other people. It felt I little strange but I accepted it and carried on being his friend again. We both moved to a 'big city' through our jobs and work and would meet lots of different people and introduce each other to new friends. We would periodically check in with each other and see how each other are doing, even if we couldn't hang out for weeks on end. We were in a band for a while, threw parties and events. We both went through break ups with our long time partners at different times, and helped each other out in that regard. We basically became 'close friends' and expressed this to each other. Then I introduced him to a group of old friends of mine who recently moved into the city. They all began to hang out with him and it was all good. He even hooked up with one of those friends and have been together for years. I too found a partner I have been with for a a couple years now. Now, over the past couple years he has began to hang out with all of those friends and much less of me. He hardly ever reaches out to catch up or hang out. Months will go by. I try to reach out and stay in touch with him but he does not reciprocate. I had been dealing with this over the past couple years now. I finally called him that I feel a little hurt and that it feels like he doesn't reach out or try to stay in touch- or care for that matter. His response is ""I'm just too busy"" sort of answer. I can also see on social media that he does hang out with other people- mostly the friends I've introduced him to. I feel really hurt by this. I don't understand why he all the sudden doesn't seem to care about me. I don't feel like I have any good friends I can go to anymore. Other close friends have done the same. I have had other friends that I became pretty close with who later I feel like started to treat me like they were 'too cool' to hang out with me anymore. I start to feel less respected and cared about. I'll ask them about things they're doing in their lives and won't be asked the same questions in return. When I do put forward information about things is my life I feel like they're less and less taken seriously or completely indifferent to it. Here's the other thing that confuses me: Some of these friends years later come out of the blue- if I run into them or they start commenting a ton on fb post and act like nothing happened and sometimes they are eager to hang out again. It makes me feel like all the sudden I've done something cool enough, or are hanging out with people they are interested in and want to join in. I don't know whether to ignore them or try to let things go and be friends. My fear is that if I do, we may become close again and they will just do the same thing. Im very confused why this happens. I don't know if I'm doing something to encourage this. When I say 'close friend' I do not mean calling every day or even every week and sharing every aspect of each other lives. Close friend just means some one you can talk to every once in a while, and who checks in to see how the other is doing. Is that asking for too much? I feel envious when I see how my girlfriend has couple good friends she talks to about her life and issues. I think it's healthy to have close friends other than your significant other you can do this with, I just don't understand why I can't hold close friends. Any advice would be welcomed. As a side note: since this has happened with my 'close friend' I have tried to widen my net and reach out to other people to hang out. I am becoming extremely exhausted. At age 33 now, I feel it is so difficult to try to hang out with other people. I feel like I do all the reaching out and it's making me feel extremely bitter about friends and relationships. I understand about casual friends, networking, or friends that are united around similar interests. I just get frustrated when that is the only thing that holds people together. I wonder- is that a symptom of living in a big city where everyone is trying to 'make it?' I think that, but then I'll hear

"My daughter is entitled and ungrateful Last weekend my 21 year old college daughter fell and was taken to the hospital via ambulance. We got a call from the hospital and my wife and I drove 4.5 hours to spend the night with her in the hospital. While there she had to go to the bathroom but called a nurse because she had to use a bed pan. Just before she went she asked us to leave the room and my wife and I refused because we wanted to get a cute photo of her on the bed pan to post to Facebook and compare to a baby photo of her when she first learned how to pee. She got very upset and called the nurse and told her to remove us from the room. This upset us, especially my wife but we tried to keep out composure until she was released from the hospital. We dropped her off at her apartment and my wife spent the 4.5 hour drive home crying because we can't believe how spoiled and selfish our daughter has become.

And yes I have had a better life then a lot but dose that lessen my experience and hardships ? Yes I have a supportive family and yes I have friends that are willing to listen to my bullshit, but dose that really lessen my inner turmoil and trouble with my mind, so I have to be fucking stabbed by my own brother to make it legit ? Yes I know nobody liked school, but did they all make themselves believe it was school or nothing, and when they ended up at a dead and was convinced that there life was over !? Did all kids struggle with basics in school ?! Did every kid end up feeling alone no Mather what he or she did there entire life ?! Did they have to feel so alone and unconnected ?! I know full well that anyone else wold have done a better job in life then me, I know Iâm wasted potential and probably will never live up to the standers my brother set before me, donât you think I know that ?! Donât you think at eats at me almost every waking moment of my existence?! Am I really that defective that I am just not good enough ?! Just because things are moving forward and good for now doesnât make my feelings and inner turmoil go away ! Do you think I wanted/want to be this sad excuse of a human being ?! I canât say anything to anyone, I have learnt that I not only feel alone but I am alone, people just end up getting tired of my shit anyway, so I guess Iâll have to go back to bottling everything inside again, maybe when the glass brakes and I cave i will be free, maybe I will find my freedom in death....idk anymore I just donât know ....sorry for the long rant and thanks for reading if you did...

"Best guy friend is ignoring me, and I don't understand why My best guy friend ""Jake"" (not his real name) have known each other for 14 years. We are now both 19 years old. Of all the friends I currently have, I've been friends with Jake the longest. We first met in kindergarten. I used to be really chubby and shy when I was much younger, so I got picked on a lot. Jake was my only friend back when I was in elementary school and middle school, and he stood up for me a lot back then. In high school, I started to grow out of my childhood awkwardness, lost a significant amount of weight, and managed to find a small group of friends in my school's anime club. Throughout all this, Jake was a very steady, loyal, and supportive friend, and I'm forever grateful to him for that. We ended up getting into different colleges, both around an hour away from our hometown. Even though things got somewhat busy at times, we kept in regular contact and found time to hang out when we were both in our hometown at the same time. Recently, I met a great guy ""Aaron"" (not his real name) in college. We started dating. I wanted him to meet my friends from back home, so I arranged a time to meet for dinner. During our meetup (I invited 3 friends from high school, including Jake), I noticed that Jake was unusually quiet. He didn't say much of anything during our dinner. I thought it was a bit weird because he is normally really talkative (I'm usually the quieter one in our friendship), so I pulled him aside and asked him what's wrong. He said nothing, so I figured nothing was wrong. That meetup was two months ago. About two weeks ago, I reached out to Jake on Facebook to ask him how things are going and to try to catch up on life. He completely ignores all my messages. I tried texting him to ask if he's mad at me. No response. I don't understand. I feel completely blindsided by this because Jake has never gone more than one day without responding to my messages. A mutual friend told me that she always suspected that Jake liked me, but I highly doubt that. He never showed any signs of liking me back when we were in high school, and he had a couple of girlfriends in high school. He's not the shy type, so I highly doubt he would be the type of guy to hide his feelings for so many years.

"Group of friends exclude one person and Iâm now stuck I between... So I have a group of about 13 friends, some of us have been friends most of our lives and others have joined over the past 10 years. One friend Iâve always be closest to went though a tough time recently and it was decided by some of the louder group members that she shouldnât be part of the group anymore as she wasnât making any effort and she was being a drama queen! (She definitely was not and they were all being extremely judgemental without knowing her full story) I totally disagreed with them and confronted them about it. The loud ones argued back and the others stayed quiet and a few then spoke to me privately later and said they agreed with me. There are a few that I will never again consider a friend going forward! My dilemma is that there are still a good few in the group I enjoy spending time with and would like to remain friends with and I am also friends with the excluded friend! I feel that I either have to leave the friendship group or remain in it and stay quiet about how awfully they treated my friend and put up with the nasty few! Either way I feel awful. I donât really know the purpose of this post but I donât really have any other friends so if I break away from this group I wouldnât have any left apart from the other excluded friend. Iâm not sure they really are my friends anymore as they havenât been there for me recently so I suspect Iâd be next on the chopping block anyway.

"Relationship with my Dad Hey, I post this as I need help on how to deal with the situation on my relationship with my Dad. Don't get me wrong, I do love him- however I am not sure that I like him to the extent that he likes me. By like, I mean as a ""buddy"" relationship, we have similar interests and we talk about these interests a lot, but his personality irritates me and we have gotten in a lot of arguments, of which I never convince him. I am currently in University, I am living on campus (this is the first time living on my own), and I must say: I am absolutely loving it. Having my first time being independent has made me feel much better. Mainly because I am away from home. I have this thing where I just want to be independent, not influenced by other people's views/thoughts (my Dad mainly). A couple of years ago my Mum and Dad broke up, I stayed with my Dad as I did not agree with what my Mum had done. Me and my Dad were always close as we are both into Gaming and watching TV shows etc... but it is only recently that I have realized I dislike him. My Dad can be quick at losing his temper, he lives by the policy of Honesty (which is a good trait), but at the same time- he is completely contradicting. In arguments we get into, I explain my view and so does he, however he turns my view against me and then later apoligises for not understanding, making sure he will listen better in future. This never happens. This has persisted over the years and it makes me feel uneasy talking to him about anything. I then feel guilty about not wanting to talk to him. Which brings me to my next issue. He talks to me daily. Once in morning, some points during the day and then at night. I understand this is his first time living alone too, but I need my space and it is physically and mentally draining having to talk to him. Especially as I feel forced to keep the conversation going. Pretty much the majority of the conversation is me talking about my day, my thoughts on things and anything interesting that happened. He briefly mentions his stuff, but then there is silence. I try to keep the conversation flowing, but it does NOT feel natural at all. It is not like the conversations I have with my friends or other members of the family. Which again, makes me feel guilty when I want to hang up. I really have tried to change my perspective. It is getting close to moving back home (I am a first year student) and will be commuting from my home town to University for the upcoming years at Uni. I am really not looking forward to this. I am enjoying spending time AWAY from home, to avoid my Dad. Now I am going to have to live with him for the next few years. Now I do love him, and he does everything for me. He is trying to pay off my Student loans so I feel comfortable, and I have been saving for my deposit that I will put on a house after my time at Uni. But the issue is, I really want independence. I feel guilty that I want to live in the city where my Uni is and work to pay joint rent with friends. This way I learn the world of work, but that comes with having higher stress as I'd have to work and study. Which is what my dad doesn't agree with. And trying to explain to him that I want to learn the world of work does not compute with him. As rationally speaking, there are many more benefits of me commuting. And I cannot win, I really can't. He wants me to get the best oppotunity I can in life, and make sure that I get my Masters. But, he is deciding and forcing my path for me. I feel restricted and it makes me feel down most days for each time I have to talk to him. It just reminds me of the next 3 years being stuck at home with him, him thinking we have this great relationship where I just prefer literally anything else. Thank you.

I don't see my dad's side of the family that much after I moved because its a long commute. However we still send out Christmas cards and two of them call from time to time. One of my Aunts was having a retirement party and my mom went to it out of obligation more than out of wanting to. The Aunt who the party was for was welcoming and nice to her but the rest were just talking amongst themselves about politics and other crap. One of my other Aunts who lives outside of the area (compared to us and the others) went up to my mom and said hi to her but when she asked about me she said ""How's your daughter?"". Everyone else who asked about me asked about me by name,so my mom took notice of this and found it odd. She told me about it when she got home and it bothered me. I was the flowergirl in the wedding for this particular Aunt, so I don't see how she could not even remember my name anymore. Is it reasonable to be bothered by this? I used to send them christmas cards (and I signed my name) but they haven't sent anything back in recent years. I don't feel like bothering to even try now. They send us things asking for money for their kids school from time to time but nothing else.

"Made grandma feel old XD Setting of this story is morbid but this is my favorite memory with my grammy. I'm about to turn 22 and this took place back in November of 2017. My family lives all along Western Washington and we don't see each other often, so it was bittersweet to see everyone at my great grandmothers funeral. My cousins and I sat together at one end of the table when we all went to lunch after at a fancy restaurant with our moms next and then grandparents. Only two of us kids are old enough to drink, me and my 28 year old cousin. No one blinked an eye when he ordered an Irish coffee. But then the baby (me) ordered a rum and coke. This resulted in two things. 1. My mom and cousin laughing at me because my original order was for Southern Comfort and coke and they said I drink poor people booze (I'm 21 fresh out of college what do you expect) 2. My grandmother nearly had a heart attack when she even heard me utter that I wanted alcohol. What made this even funnier was when I got my drink and she mentioned to my mom how she keeps forgetting I'm not 16 anymore.

"Post graduation depression is real. It's been 5 months after graduating from college and I've never been depressed more than ever. Unemployed and feeling worthless. Parents are forcing me to get a job already, Peers landed their dream jobs / found a job that pays well and earning more money than me. The feeling of being worthless is overwhelming. Crushing. While unemployed, I've finished a free short course on graphic design and got my certification after passing the assessment and currently doing one on web development. I want to learn more skills in order to land a good job. But I don't think my parents would understand, as they want me to get a job already, any job (Customer Service Representative jobs are a trend in our country which most of fresh graduates end up, I'm not detesting that kind of job but it ain't my thing). I'm depressed more than ever. Fucking anxiety. I've been avoiding my peers because I don't want them to see me unemployed and broke. I'm anxious because I don't think I'm worth it and anxiety had been a problem for years. I'm depressed because of the pressure my parents are giving me. I'm mad because nobody understands me. I'm sad because I don't have anybody. I'm afraid because I might end up a loser in the end. I'm a mess because of the all of the above. (God. I sound like a whiny bitch on my first post here on this subreddit.) Anybody else feeling like me? What/Should I do?

"Annoyed and I feel absolutely horrible about it My parents have recently recovered from some financial issues that caused them to move out of state. A little over a year ago, my father found a job back in the state where I currently live and has been staying at my place during the weeks when he works. As much as I love my parents though, sometimes I really struggle with sharing my limited space, i.e. a very small one bedroom apartment. What makes it even more difficult is the fact that I rarely ever know ahead of time when he's coming and when he isn't. And when he does come, he doesn't knock. He just walks right in using the spare key that I came home to find was gone (without first being asked if it was okay to take) a while back. It honestly makes me feel like I'm twelve again. I worked very hard to become independent and to have my own life and space and now... I don't. I hadn't even been on my own for a year when all of this started. I can't say anything about it because my mother always downplays it by saying, ""You'll be fine. We're family."" And the one time I even indirectly said something to my father, just by casually asking if he'd taken my spare key, I got a phone call from my mother saying that he was upset and essentially blamed me for them having to move to begin with. Long story short, I don't know what to do. I feel so terrible to be annoyed with the situation, but I am.

"Functional depression?? Is anyone here in a similar boat? I have a bachelor degree, girlfriend, am athletic although exercise on and off. Having trouble finding a stable career but iâm optimistic. Tried getting a masters degree but itâs not working out so far. Anyways what iâm trying to say is that on paper my life seems ok, but iâve tried a few therapists, medications and nothing is getting me out of this hole of low mood, motivation, and occasional thoughts. I still skip meals, eat junk, sleep inconsistently, have days where iâm ready to quit everything. I do have little people to talk to and feel connected with even though i have parents, and some friends. Itâs been several years now like this. Does it get better? Thatâs what people say, am i missing something? Am i overthinking everything? Anyways thanks for reading.

"I can't stop dreaming about having friends. I don't know why I use this daydreaming technique every single day. I can't trust real people because they always seem selfish to me. I have that weird, twisted image of having a best friend who doesn't judge me and enjoys spending time with me, but it's not real. People are not perfect and I push them away or worse, I don't and they use me or tease me forever because apparently I'm too kind and I act like a stray animal. What should I do? I'm so lost. How can I escape my dreams? I'm 26 and I don't have any close friends and I end up talking to my cats or my plushy because interacting with humans makes me incredibly tense. I'm on meds. I was beaten, I sometimes talk too loudly or too quietly because I was a shut-in for a year and I can't control my voice sometimes, maybe that's the problem? How to quit chatting with my imaginary friends so I'm less lonely and depressed?

"Feel like I have no right to feel this way People have it worse than me, while I, a privileged man with a loving family, cannot feel most of the time. I hate using the term âdepressedâ. Even as Iâm writing this, I feel like I want to delete it. Itâs being thrown around so much lately that I feel like Iâm just being a little bitch that uses it like I donât know it. Have been seeing therapists for months, talking to them and trying to find a way on how to see life differently. Thankfully Iâm not prescribed any of those fucking pills, because my current therapist is smart enough to know they arenât the best medicine for me. Whenever I feel joy, it lasts for a minute, then Iâm back in my own dark world. Very dark world. I think about suicide, screaming at people, wanting to beat some people up. Then I lay down, and feel guilty for thinking about such horrible thoughts. Sorry for the rant. Today was a shitty day and I had to let it out somehow...

"Dear reddit, happiness isn't a choice for everyone I'm sorry but I need to get this off my chest in a place where people will understand me. Dear people that think happiness is a choice, it's not. Me or my fellow sufferers don't choose to be miserable. In fact if it really was that simple, I'm sure 99% of us would choose to be happy without even having to think. I feel sad because I have mental illness. If you don't know, that means my brain isn't normal. My brain has deficiencies and such that keep me from feeling happy, even when I should. I'm so sick of reading replies to mine and other people's post about depression that try to oversimplify a serious mental illness that can cause suicide. I swear everyone on this website assumes we do nothing to try to help ourselves. I really can't believe people are that misinformed that they really think that many people choose to be that miserable. You wouldn't choose to be miserable if you had the choice, and so would we. But we don't get that choice. Then we have comments like ""Just put a life together that wont make you depressed"". I think these piss me off the most. If it was really that simple you think I would of done that by now? Also a lot of people don't mention how hard changing your life can be if you don't have money or resources. TLDR: Stop oversimplifying a serious illness

I ask, and they just ignore my texts or say they're busy. I know everyone is really busy in uni, but I take this so personally. I feel like no one ever wants to be around me.

"Going to bed in the morning, waking up at night. For about a year now, I've been going to sleep in the morning when the rest of my family is getting ready to start their day and getting out of bed in the evening/night. It started because I transferred to online school and I thought it would be fine to stay up until 3 am or so, but it's gradually gotten worse and worse and as I'm typing this it's 9 am and I'm just now getting ready to sleep. I'm guessing I'll wake up at about 3 pm and actually get out of bed at 4. It's really screwing with my coursework and making my mental and physical health worse. People keep giving me reasonable advice like turning off distractions and forcing myself to go to bed, or even staying up the whole day so I'm very tired by nighttime, but I just can't find the willpower to go to sleep or get up. I'm not motivated to do anything anymore that I don't have to do. I'm starting to feel like a complete failure. Has anyone else experienced this or is experiencing it? (Also I'm taking a lot of melatonin but it still doesn't motivate me to actually get into bed.)

"Lost my dad and my pet within the last two weeks. We took my dad to the hospital and found out he had a tumor in his colon. They removed it and several surgeries later he was in recovery, eating, and ready to come home. My mom spent day and night by his side for over a month at the hospital and refused to leave his side. Finally he was recovering and they told her she can go home since they're transferring him to a hospital closer to us. She comes home and the next morning we find out he died in his sleep from a heart attack. After surviving all the surgeries, he dies alone the same night my mom went home. On top of that, we didn't get along well. I'm not even sure he knew I cared about him. All the responsibilities fell on me since both my parents were gone for a month. I didn't have time to drive to the hospital he was at. We had his memorial service and funeral.. then things started to calm down. My mom and I spent time making the house spotless and reorganizing. I woke up this morning to find out that the cat I've had for 6-7 years got hit by a car. I buried him in a box outside our house and now I'm just laying here, wondering if it's going to get any worse before it gets better.

"Should I attempt to repair our friendship one last time? So a few months ago a close friend and I had a sort of fight because I made a shitty passive aggressive comment. I apologised shortly afterwards and felt terrible about it, even apologised more a day later. Anyhow they said they needed some space, we happened to work together and sit right next to each other. So I left them be for awhile, they basically refused to even look or speak to me. After a month or so this started to take its toll on me, emotionally and mentally I wasn't equipped to deal with it. So eventually after 66 days of this, something I could not get away from I snapped and out of desperation as I was losing my mind I told I'm walking away as without communication the friendship is doomed. So that's where it ended, they then carried on ignoring me for the rest of our time at work, they eventually left to go to a new place. Even at the farewell I was ignored till the last 10 minutes then got some communication. After that a couple weeks later on my birthday they randomly wished me a happy birthday on a work group. Completely unexpected, sadly this confused the shit out of me and I drunkenly sent some message about being tired of all the hurt. Then I was blocked. I have since not contacted them in any way for over a month. Do I make another attempt and how would I word it or should I just leave it and see if anything happens, we were really close and I feel awful about hurting them. It was the only argument in a year and a half we had.

"How do I befriend my crush? So there's this girl (21/f) that I (21/f) really, really like. I live in a super homophobic country. I've accepted the fact that nothing can happen between us. However, she's just such, such an amazing person, that even if we weren't romantically involved, I would want her in my life, as a friend, because she's just so great - no joke. I'm not sure what her impression of me is. My crush and I actually have a ton of mutual acquaintances and friends. We've even worked together on an event before, but it was a large scale event with a large team, so I didn't really feel much. She once even smiled at me when she saw me! I have a friend who once had a guy give her chocolate that he âcouldnât finishâ when we were in the library. The next day, he messaged her on Facebook, saying she probably felt weirded out by what he did â she responded to him, and they started talking to each other. Theyâve now been dating for over a year. The bottom line is, with all this information in mind, how do I approach my crush to hopefully start a friendship with her? I've been warned that I should draw a mental boundary between feelings of friendship and romantic feelings, which Iâm set on doing. I would do what my friendâs boyfriend did, but with these chocolate chip cookies I baked, though I'm not sure if it'd be a good idea. It would seem a little weird, wouldnât it? Even with my friendâs boyfriend, we knew his intentions from the start. My crush and I are both girls, however, so I suppose that changes things a little (we do live in a heteronormative society). With all that said, Iâm pretty desperate, as sheâs graduating soon, and I really donât want to miss my chance. She's completed all her subjects and is currently only working on her dissertation. She's often in the student lounge, doing work - though I'm not sure what her schedule is like and what days she's in campus. Please help with creative ways to approach my crush (like my friend's boyfriend did)! Thanks!

"I can't stop thinking about suicide and it's making it hard to do anything I cant get these thoughts of suicide out of my head. The word just keeps popping up in my head. I keep thinking of where I could go, or what effect it would have. I can't get it out of my head. I've been staring at reddit doing absolutely nothing because every time i do something it keeps coming up again and it just distracts me until im slumped in my chair staring or lying on the ground. I used to smoke weed all the time, I like to think it helped me ignore my depression, but it really just made my depression make me more useless than i already am. I don't see the any sort of happy ending to my life. The happiest i can see myself attain is dying alone with a self-published book thats gone unread till I die, then maybe someone will read it. I dont see myself ever finding love, I see friends leaving every minute, every conversation I have with family only makes them hate me more. I try so hard everyday. I feel like im the only one trying. I adapt to my friends, they never pay me mind. I adapt to my family, they dont pay me mind. Its easier staying in my room all day. Where I don't have to exhaust myself in adapting to everyone. Where I don't fuck everything up. I just want to do my homework. I don't want these thoughts anymore. I'm not sure i actually will.

"A letter to a person I let down To The Person I Miss The Most, Happy birthday man, I miss you and Iâm sorry. It feels like so much time has gone by that any attempt at reconciliation would do more harm than anything else at this point. We used to have so much fun, but nostalgia only makes everyone feel worse, and more often than not leads to poor choices. Itâs a sweet substance, like sugar, just with a punch in the gut to remind you that you canât ever go back to something you once valued so highly. Itâs been a year and a couple months since weâve talked, and thereâs rarely a day where you donât cross my mind. Iâm not saying thatâs healthy, because it sure as hell isnât, but who cares anyways. I wasnât good for you, you were too good for me, we crashed and burned and I loved every second of it. Was it worth it? Maybe. Does that matter? Not in the slightest. Now I just sit alone in the dark writing you letters that I know youâll never fuckinâ read, pretending in my head that thereâs some fucking way that i can salvage the situation. Itâs like watching someone stand at the bottom of the pool drowning, when all they have to do is swim to the surface. Iâm cold, and tired, wasting time and throwing away opportunities left and right because i have no idea what Iâm doing, and I know that youâre doing well, that makes me happy. You deserve to succeed. Youâve been to hell and back, and I might as well have been the chauffeur for a good portion of it. I loved you, I donât think I do anymore, but I know I did. I thought about comparing how I felt about you with a bunch of shitty metaphors but letâs be honest, that isnât our style. Weâd probably laugh at how cheesy it was and how stupid this whole situation is and then weâd pull out our guitars and write a beautiful sad duet and Iâd be out of tune while you hit every note perfectly. But you wouldnât critique me, thatâs just the way you are. Too kind, and sweet, too good to everyone you came across even though you knew there was a pretty good chance that theyâd never return the favor. And man I really tried to, all those times we walked around talking about how much we wanted to die and how sad we were, but the whole thing was build on the back of our own loneliness and sadness. But thatâs the past. Nostalgia is bullshit, but I have to indulge once in awhile just to feel something, Iâm sure you remember that. Hereâs to better times ahead, and a letter left unread. Sincerely, Your Old Best Friend

"Should I call my friend out on his bs? My friend is a guy. It seems like he wants to be oppressed so badly. Itâs kinda funny but mostly insulting. A few nights ago he was telling me that he was bi-racial (mix of two races, would happen if Mom and dad were different races) even though both of his parents are white af and he isnât adopted. He told me he has autism and was disabled even though he exhibits 0 autistic traits and I know he hasnât been diagnosed. When I ask him what his disability is, he always gives shady or different answers. He keeps saying he has schizophrenia but when I ask, he is always like âwhat? ...... oh yeaâ like he needs to be reminded about an illness that is supposed to seriously impact his life. He keeps telling me he is gay but after a little drinking he tells be about a girl he has a crush on. It is funny seeing min try so hard to be in an oppressed minority when he clearly is not but it is also really insulting because I am in a minority. I am disabled and have to be on a wheelchair, I have been diagnosed with schizophrenia and Iâm lgbt. What should I do?

"I hate it when bad people get rewarded One of the facts that depresses me most about life is when bad people get rewarded and live comfortably, and loved by all. It's hard for me to stomach. For example, I saw one of my former bullies enter the store I work at. She was absolutely terrible toward me when we were in high school, such as defacing my sketchbook, purposefully kicking my food away, sending me fake ""love letters"", and more. Anyway, the bully now had two children (I'm having trouble conceiving so that stings), and I think the bully could smell my fear because she headed right to my counter, and began to make a show of how expensive everything was in our store while also ""catching up"" by telling me about how successful she is with her self made interior design business. When I got home that night, I looked her up on Facebook, and...she does have a much better life than mine. In every way. I feel angry that she seemed to have a great one while I've...struggled.

The first secret Iâm keeping is Snapchat. Iâm not really supposed to have it but all my friends did so I made an account maybe last month and I use it regularly. I donât see the need to tell my mom about this :/ But what I want to tell her but am afraid to is that I am dating someone. Last year I dated a boy and she wasnât mad, she just wanted to know everything. I mean everything. Sheâd go through all my messages with him, sheâd stalk him on Instagram (from my account!), sheâd see if he texted me and sit next to me on the bed and watch me text him and tell me what I can and canât say. Iâm not an inappropriate girl. I get straight Aâs, I shame on premarital sex and all that. Itâs not like Iâm a underage whore (trust me, we have those) and I wonât send nudes! I really like this guy and he likes me back. He told his mom we were dating literally the day he asked me out. My best friend and her crush (who likes her back) already told their moms about each other. My mom wonât let me date anymore because itâs a âdistractionâ and I donât need to be âmessing with hormonal boysâ WHICH IâM NOT ! (Also I text this guy on SnapChat, thatâs another reason I canât tell her I have it because then she would demand my password for it and then look through all my messages on there.) I just wish it would be as easy for me as it is easy for them to tell my mom. Its making me feel super guilty because just yesterday she told me âI love you. Youâre such a good daughter.â Which sheâs NEVER told me before and she hugged me which she never does unless she wants something. Iâm literally just trying to have some fun in middle school like everyone else. :( Please help.

"This girl I don't really know walked up to me and drew a heart on my paper I know it's something so small and meaningless but it made me really feel better. My day was really hard and some portions I felt as if I was going to start crying. I despise myself and the fact that someone can walk up to me and draw something kind of sweet and cute on my paper makes me feel less gross and insecure. Sadly my awkward self didn't respond very fast and by the time my brain was able to form a ""aww thank you"" she walked away. Thanks Trinity, that was really nice, it really did make me feel better.

"I have gone days without talking to anyone I just got out of a bad relationship recently. But I have a issue with dependancy. I let him dictate my entire life. I let him into my head to the point I feel brainwashed. I hate everyone. I don't trust anyone. I don't want to talk to anyone because I know he will get mad and be jealous. He is the closest and only person I have in my life and even though we broke up he wants us to remain best friends. We dated for 2 years and it was Rocky the entire time. But I let him get his hooks into me and I can't get out. I am terrified to not have him in my life because then I will be truly alone. I don't talk to anyone else. I am 26 years old and I have 0 friends other then him. I am terrified of being alone. But he is seeing someone else now. She is 100 times better then me in every way. She is super model gorgeous and everything that me and him shared she has as well. I feel replaced. But I don't want to not be his friend and not have him in my life. I'm terrified to lose him. I cling to the hope one day he will want me again. I haven't talked to another person in over a week. and if he is busy with her I don't talk to anyone at all. I just lay on my couch staring at the wall and having a constant never ending panic attack. I have sever depression and severe anxiety that I take medicine for both. But they only make the feelings bearable and don't take them away completely. I don't sleep. I just want to throw myself at every fuck boy on dating apps just to have some kind of physical attention even if it is only sex. Even if I am not attracted to them. I don't care. I just want someone to love me. I want someone to hold me and make me feel not alone. I don't know what to do. I feel like I've been kicked in the chest. It hurts to breathe. I made a noose and stood on a stool with it around my neck for over a hour the other night crying. But I couldn't do it. I don't know how to go on living.

"Being Manipulated Hi, so, I recently met this new group of people, and it's been pretty nice being with them, but there's this one girl that I have a crush on. About a week ago, one of my friends whom I have known for ~4 years told her, and she said there was a high chance she would go out with me, and has been telling me stuff she has said, and he said that if I was going to ask her out, I should wait 1-3 weeks. Well, recently, they seem to be getting closer and closer to each other, and I have heard that he has a crush on her as well, and wants her to date him instead of me, and when I asked him about it, he got all defensive about it. For a little bit of extra context, he said that he wouldn't ask her out, but would be open to dating her. What should I do? Edit: He said he was trying to get her to go out with me, and said he was helping me.

"The one upside of being depressed I've recently noticed something that has, strangely enough, somehow helped me a bit with my depression. See, I've started not ""sweating the small stuff."" For example; stuck in traffic? It's okay. Spilled my coffee? Oh, well. My co-worker is annoying? Doesn't phase me. My thought process is like this: when I wake up and feel like dying, at least the spilled coffee gives me something to do in the mean time. Or standing in a queue forces me to be more in the present and not as much in my head. Since I came to realise this, I've noticed an increase in my general mood, or at least I've become better at coping with going outside, shopping etc.

"Just graduated university. Anxious and depressed, can't find a job, scared of losing partner over it Hi everyone. This is my first post on Reddit. I just felt like I needed advice from people who might understand. I'm in my early twenties and just graduated with a bachelor degree in psych in October. I never really had a job during that time because I was lucky to have my school and expenses paid for and I wanted to focus on school. I've only had one job but it was 5 years ago just at a fast food place. My boyfriend of almost 4 years and I live together. He has a great job and pays for 2/3 of our expenses and I pay the rest. He's recently told me he doesn't see a future for us if I don't get my life together and find a job and start putting more into the relationship. I feel this is coming at a bad time because ever since I graduated I am really anxious and depressed. I find it hard to even get up in the morning, chores get neglected, I don't even want to get out of the safety of my bed. The world is bleak and I'm sad all the time. I can't sleep all night and then sleep till mid afternoon. I feel like my life is just staying home and having to do chores and feel sad. I try to apply to entry level jobs like cashier at the grocery store but no one calls back. I don't know what to do because I want to get better and don't want to lose my bf but I can't even get an interview to work at a high school level job. He has been really supportive and caring but I think he is getting to the end of his rope. I feel stuck and hopeless. Any suggestions?

"I went to College for Political Science. Now I can't stand politics. When I started college in 2012, my goal was to join the foreign service to represent my country to people abroad. I loathe Trump and all he stands for. My grandmother lost every single relative in Europe to the Nazis, and two days after the election I saw another student at the University come in wearing an SS logo. And with Nazis marching every month I am am ashamed to be American. I have been running behind in college for a while, but as long as I had serving my country to look forward to I kept going. At this point though I would rather be dead than associated with this country. I can't even avoid the toxicity of politics because that is what my degree is in. I spent the last year trying as hard as I could to think of any reason to keep going. I can't find one. I wrote my first suicide note last month all about my feeling of meaninglessness in a country that killed the country I loved. While I wallowed in self loathing, I have costed my mother so much money. Once my sister started college she had to cash out her 401k to keep us both in college because I didn't get a scholarship and didn't graduate. I would get a job, but I don't have a driver's license and public transportation doesn't go by my house. When I drop out of school my student loans will come due, and if I can't pay them my family will try. The only way out I can think of is death. My student loans are of a type that are forgiven if I die, so my family would save more by just paying to have me buried than to pay off my debt.

"My mother died...Left me more the siblings My mother died recently. She had a retirement account and life insurance. I have two siblings. The benefits are being paid and She left me much more then them. I received about 50-60% of her money. I feel guilty and I'm afraid my siblings will forever have animosity towards me and my mother. Both siblings left long ago. One out of state and one out of the country. I was the only one around for my mom for more then 15yrs. She got cancer three years ago along with other illnesses and suffered a great deal. I was the only one here to help. Her last year and a half was very tough and I was her full time caregiver. I gave up a everything. As a business owner I Lost most my clients, compiled a mountain of debt and now I am alone to care for her house ( I gave up my place) and pay the mortgage. One sibling says it's unfair that I got more then twice him. The conversation killed me because I think he is hurt by it and I feel guilty. My mom told them before she died that I got the lions share but he says he didn't think it was this much of a disparity. I don't know what to do or how I should feel. She always told me she had her reasons. Part of me thinks that fair isn't always equal and I want to tell him that. At the same time I don't want to feel entitled or like I deserve something more. I don't know what to do if anything. I don't feel like I should give them some of my inheritance. I guess I am looking for a little validation and a little advise. side note: I don't think insurance companies and retirement funds should reveal the total policy or amounts and beneficiaries payout percentage. This is what causes problems.

"Fucked up Families- Mamas From Hell We all got that fucked up incident in our families, right? Well, Imma vent about mine, cause it real fucked. For me at least, right, so am a naive virgin eighteen year old, wanna yknow experience sex and dig a guy and stuff, so I go on the dating apps and meet a lad, real nice too, sweet and that, I obviously am attracted to him. So we date and do all the couple stuff like movies and sex and I am on cloud nine cause he an older man so like am cool at school (super super shallow and lame but yknow, naive virgin eighteen year old trying to live up to social pressures exerted by my peers). Anyway, I like the dude, and we fall for each other, we married now with kids so we chill. Right, so a month or two in, he gets all funny on a night out and makes us go somewhere quiet away from our mates, which I dont catch onto cos yknow am like shitfaced and cant feel my face so I dont realise nothing is up at all. Right so he says to me, I shagged a girl before you and am like dude thats not a surprise yknow you told me you had women before me. That shit fair enough cause hes older and yknow its normal for partners to experiment before settling for one. And he goes well I like you, a lot, and I dont want this girl to ruin shit and am like, well I dont see how you arent still shagging her are you? he isnt still shagging her right, so yknow good boy, however, he shagged her before me, like six months before me and yknow what can happen in six months? A goddamn baby can grow in the mofo womb during that time. Hes pissed, he was like I told her it was a shag, she agreed, told me she was on the pill and it mustve glitched that month (as the story always goes) and she got preggaz. I told her to terminate (dude this is a condensed version of the story, there was emotion and shit behind it, so dont go all prolife on me, it's just a minor detail im trying get out there and passed so I can tell the rest of the story). Right, so she starts kicking off saying hes emotionally black mailing her into an abortion and talking about a baby she lost as a teen and shit and am like, okay so just back off. He did, and she came back a few months later like lol theres another guy, not sure if hes the dad or not, I think its you tho. Like, good, thanks bitch, a think its you is all the proof I need. So she sends him laods of scans and basically pretends hes her baby daddy. Annoyed me a bit cos yknow i was a teen wanting to mess round and just yknow settle with this guy and this chick is trying to like worm her way in. She makes friends with his sister on fb (weird cos he doesnt have contact with any of his family, hasnt for like four years prior that) and starts getting pally with his mum dad brothers, all of them. Tells them I was his mistress and they were a couple, they decided to have a baby, and when she got pregnant he started messing round with me, a teenage girl. Fews holes in that story but well skip ahead, and the baby is born. They get this dodgy dna that says its not admissable in court due to infrequencies or something and that close relatives (she was shagging his brother at the time too) could skewer results. Basically the baby daddy could be his bro but itll come back his cause its a shit dna. Anyway it came back the baby was his and he suddenly goes all fatherly. Doesnt see the kid for like six months then starts visits and pays maintance. Meanwhile, shes fucking round going to his family and bitching about how horrible I am being a homewrecker and all that eventho they were a shag and got with him six months after her. He wont get another dna cause he was like paid for one not doing another, and I explained the issues but he wont. ALl our children look identical, the kid has blond hair and blue eyes, me and my partner are both dark and so are our kids, (the girl in question also is dark so where the fuck blond blue eyes came from is beyond me). For months after she kept ringing me saying omg you need to put him on the phone the babys sick and he needs to visit, and if you ignore it shed up it and be like an ambulance is coming now omg its serious (it never was). The kid was in hospital like twenty times in his first week of life, each time let out with nothing serious wrong, altho she exaggurated and made out he was on the brink of death. Tries to get him to take her kids out while Im in mofo labour, giving birth and shes kicking off on the phone saying hes not spending enough time with them. Once I gave birth comes round screaming and shouting how hes off the birth certificate, how shes changing the kids name and how shes taking him to court for more money yhadda yhadda yhadda. Mama from Hell, legit worst parent and just a nightmare to deal with, the shit that baby been through already, feel sorry for it. Your mamas from hell?

"How to drift away from a 'best friend' you don't like anymore? I have a friend, and I am trying to put distance between us. They're generally a nice person (but do some mean things occasionally), but they're quite... boring. Okay, very boring. I don't even know how I have been able to put up with the lack of interesting conversation for the past 2 years. I need a best friend with whom I can laugh about fun stuff and not just talk about SCHOOL. Let's call them B. B has clung to me for the past 2 years, so they don't have any other friends. I have loads of other friends, but they all assume that I'm best friends with B, so they don't make an effort to include me in their friendship group. I've told quite a few of them, and they are giving me some advice on what to do, but I want to see what all of you say. For the past few weeks, I have been making it quite clear that I don't really want to talk to B. I give them short answers as replies, don't make eye contact or initiate conversations and I have generally been ignoring them. I know it sounds mean, but I've had enough. I can't deal with clingy people. However, B is either EXTREMELY OBLIVIOUS, or they are just being really stubborn. Also, even though I am ignoring B, I sit next to them in lots of lessons, and I also hang out in the same room as them at break and lunch so they always come and shuffle next to me! SO. INFURIATING. I don't want to change rooms, because then I won't be with my friends. Another thing is that if I ignore B, I actually look like a loner. I ignore them by being antisocial in the corner doing my homework most of the time. I mean, everyone in my school already thinks I'm sort of weird child that studies all of the time, because I always seem to be studying at school (which is actually because I don't do anything at home). I also have to eat by myself at lunch, and having social anxiety definitely doesn't help with that. I know I shouldn't care about that, but it's hard not to. I went off on a tangent there, didn't I? So basically, what I'm trying to ask you is that should I completely completely ignore B (e.g. don't talk to them at all) or is that too mean? (Please don't suggest anything that says to try and be friends with them, because I don't want to do that. I want to make exciting friendships that I will remember, and not be stuck with... a boring person. Also, I'm 14. I don't know if that will help, but meh.) B has turned into one of those people that... you just want to punch in the face for no reason. Do you sort of get what I mean? Anyway, thanks for listening to this ranty thing. It took ages to write.

"I (28) did a DNA test on 23andme it told me I had a cousin I didn't know about. My BF and I decided to do DNA tests because they were on sale for black friday. We got our results back last week. I said yes to see family relationships. Turns out I have a cousin in the system. She reached out to me for information but I didn't even know she existed. Her bio mom says they she isn't ready to be in contact with her. From what I gather it was a teenage pregnancy and my grandparents forced her to give up the baby , moved her to a house for unwed mothers and moved the whole family away from their hometown to avoid embarrassment . I think it was a very traumatic experience for her and she may not want to bring up those memories. I feel stuck in the middle now and don't know how to deal with the situation. I suffer from social anxiety and this whole situation has caused me panic attacks. I feel bad for my newly found cousin and don't want to break her heart but I can't go around my aunts wishes. I don't have a lot of information about the family that I could pass on without talking to my aunt or other family members. I am the youngest cousin and my grandparents passed away when I was quite young. I'm not super close with my extended family but that's mostly due to my social anxiety , I care a lot about them and don't want to hurt any of them. Help please!

"Nightmares and dreams HI, I don't know about you, but when I was a kid I used to have this weird nightmares (not the teeth fell out usual nightmares) Like getting lost in a winter forest in pijamas just to be eaten up by wolves, being totally awake at my bed while insects ate me alive ( like sleep paralysis but dreaming?) or just watching my mother being eaten by feral dogs as she protected me. Anyway, as I grew older and my depression grew with me, I stopped having nightmares, I can barely recall when the last one was. Instead I have pretty vivid dreams (not lucid ones) and in most of them, I'm at some kind of weird scenery where I feel like I've always been there, and weird shit happens that I can remember, and it's like a full story, a lot of different things happen in the same dream. The problem is, in most of them, I meet someone, normally a girl, with which I start a mutual relationship after overcoming some hardship, like, my biggest desire. These dreams, as good as they sound, are worst than the nightmares because when I wake up, it takes some time to realize that I did not live that shit, that I'm still in bed, and I'm still alone.

"According to the mental health nurse i'm not depressed So since october 2016 i've been (or at least thought I had) been depressed. I dropped out of school, started self harming and was put in hospital twice among other things. I spent nearly the whole of 2017 at home doing nothing because I simply couldn't. I got a full time job in september but I hated it and it made me worse and I had to quit after I started self harming again and have been cutting up until now (i'm 18 by the way if that's important). Things have been getting worse again recently. I'm cutting almost every night and feel down and just cant do anything. I don't even have the energy to shower most days and just stay in bed until the late afternoon. However I was hopeful for today as I was going to see a new nurse who I was hoping would be able to set up a plan to help me. I was with the child services before and had an amazing nurse who helped me greatly but as i'm 18 i'm classed as an adult so have to go to the adult services. So as soon as I met the new nurse and we went into the room to talk she told me she knows almost nothing about me despite there being many notes from the past year. I told her about leaving my job and feeling low and the self harm and everything and what she basically told me is ''you aren't depressed''. She said that my self harm was normal as it was just scratches and I wasn't cutting deep enough to leave any scars which just completely confused me considered i'd been put in hospital partly for doing the same thing before. I've also suffered with terrible social anxiety all my life and find it very hard to communicate with others. I told her the only friends i've ever had was the friends I've made years ago when I first started going to school and what she said was it sounds like I have great social skills as i've been able to make friends. It honestly felt like she wasn't listening to a single word I was saying. As I said she had no notes from before and was basically just assuming what was wrong with me and that was it. Also I should add i'm in the UK so this is with the NHS so i'm not paying for this however my parents have said they would be willing to pay for some sessions with a therapist if that's was I need. I'm sorry if this is long or it just sounds like i'm complaining. I just wanted other peoples opinions on this as I just don't know what to think.

"I Empathize More With the Dead Than I Feel Bad for the Living There have been a few times in the past few years where I found out someone I went to high school with died of whatever means. But within the past few months, whenever I found out someone died, I didn't really feel bad for their family, I mostly was kind of jealous that they were gone and I was still here. For example, my mom manages a nursing floor at a hospital. She told me one of her nurse's daughters died of a deadly disease at 20. And all I could think about was at 21 all I could think was how jealous I was of the deceased young woman, and how lucky she was. No ill will to her, I hope she rests in peace and that her family is coping. Another example. When I was in high school, someone I knew had an older brother than went out drinking one night and when he came home, he died, choking on his own vomit. Again, I feel like there should be a lot of cautionary tales in this, but mostly I just wish I was the one that was dead.

"It's not like I don't wanna hangout with them I think I'm becoming a bit anti-social. So, I just got a job and my days off are always all over the place. When I finally DO get a day off, my friends instantly call me up and ask if I wanna hang out... the thing is, I just wanna relax. So, I always either say no to them or make up some excuse. It's not like I don't wanna hangout with them, but fuck sake I'm tired and I wanna enjoy my day off on my own. And that's probably not the best thing, I think it's me developing an anti-social attitude.

"Only friend who consistently wants to hang out with me--I've started liking him less and less! help? No names or genders here, and I'm not getting into specifics on events just in case... I have one friend who consistently wants to hang out, unlike my other friends, but the problem is that over the last few years I've started liking them less and less. They're fun to talk to and hang out with -usually- but their personality grates on me and there have been a few times when they have made me quite angry in ways that are difficult to reconcile. They can also end up being a downer though they have been working on it. An unknown quantity of my other friends also dislike them (I know a few for sure, but who knows how many they've pissed off in the meantime) so I either have to plan events without them (and they get upset) or not invite my other friends who dislike them. We've known each other for years, and they consider myself and a few others very close friends but I have gotten the distinct impression it's one-sided. But they haven't done anything wrong (to ME) that would really merit breaking up a friendship so I've kept begrudgingly hanging out with them and chatting with them even though I'd rather not and just forget they exist. At one point I was one of very, very few friends they had, but I know they have a good consistent friend group now so... I don't know! Advice, please? Is it ok to just not want to be friends anymore even if the other person hasn't done anything wrong? When I think about hanging out with them even though I know we'd probably do something fun I just feel apprehensive and mildly annoyed.

I know some illnesses have no cure. But I recently saw in a youtube comment section one person said ""I've been living with depression &amp; PTSD for 25 years, it gets easier every day blah blah blah blah..."" and someone else responded ""I recovered from depression &amp; PTSD in about 2 years... lmao"" Do those who recover quickly look down on those who recover slowly or can't recover at all?

"I feel like depression has turned my brain into mush and now I canât be successful in anything Last year I stopped being productive at work and itâs now seeping into the rest of my life. I used to receive accolades for being great at my job. I was even at the top in the nation at my job when they looked at my metrics and sales. But now Iâm just sad all of the time and I canât think straight. Every morning I wake up I start the day ready to take it on. I tell myself Iâm going to be productive and make strides to complete goals. But then I canât bring myself to do anything. There are days where I can sit at my desk for hours just thinking about how I should be working on something. But then when I try, itâs like I canât think straight. The things I used to be good at now donât really seem to make sense to me. I feel like my brain is literally turning into mush. I started seeing a therapist, I started taking anti depressants, I exercised for awhile, I tried meditating, I feel like Iâm trying everting in my power to get me mind right. But my brain is mush and now I canât be successful in anything I do. School is starting to slip and my friends keep asking why they never see me. My SO keeps telling me to âtake small stepsâ but thatâs what Iâve been doing for a year now. Itâs not working. Iâm stuck in a cycle of waned to be better and âwoe is meâ.

"Emotionally offline I shouldnât be writing this, I have three final projects due in the next couple of days and I havenât started on any of them. But I donât have the energy to even get started...I donât know what to do. Itâs too late to ask for extensions but I donât want to fail my classes (that mean nothing to me). Whatever...I guess Iâll turn out fine because I was doing well grade-wise up to this point, but itâs gonna be fucking painful. Over the course of the last couple of weeks, I feel as if Iâve gone emotionally offline. I feel like a shell of myself. Iâm not sure what happened. I think the real downturn started when I was walking on campus two weeks ago and saw my ex-girlfriend of a few months with her new boyfriend, but thatâs definitely not the only thing that is bothering me. It might have been a death-by-a-thousand-cuts situation because if I take an itinerary of whatâs going on in my life, there isnât much there. If my life had a thesis statement, itâd be that I have nothing to look forward to. Hardly any aspect of my life can bring me out of the apathy that I seem to be stuck in every day. I donât find any of my classes enjoyable, and now the thought of doing it as a career is starting to give me nightmares. I have âfriendsâ but I donât much enjoy hanging out with them, and overall, any attempts to meet new people just seems to amount to nothing. I have no dating life, and Iâm still admittedly stuck on the aforementioned ex-girlfriend (who has completely moved on) that I dated for seven months and have been broken up for the same length. All I can think about is that if she saw me today, barely able to get out of bed and go to school, Iâm also certain she would feel even more justified in breaking up with me. I keep thinking about this new person sheâs dating and in what ways he is likely a complete upgrade. I donât even know what their situation is, I am just inventing scenarios in my head. I need to stop that. Fuck. The only thing I have is that Iâm in fairly good shape and my GPA is 3.8 (although thatâs certain to go down after this week, which scares the ever-living shit out of me because it feels like the only real thing I can put on my resume). Iâm also fairly consistent with working out; itâs not a huge part of my life, but holy shit, if I didnât do it I canât imagine how depressed Iâd be. Right now, all of the emotional energy I have for the day goes to getting myself to the gym at the least. With my career, Iâm interested in how technology affects people and society; like internet addiction, social media, artificial intelligence, etc. That is kind of what drew me to my major in the first place, which is User Experience Design. However, I do little of that (the research side of things, which includes talking to people and learning their stories, then coming up with conclusions based on that data on how you can improve a digital service) and more the design/development side of things (like visual/graphic/UI design and web development, just building the fucking thing), which Iâm good with, but it both stresses me out and bores the shit out of me. I think itâd be fulfilling to be a UX Researcher for a popular social app just because I would be able to study how people interact with it. Or do that for a consultancy/agency or something, and start a blog/podcast about technology+society. I kind of largely detest the Silicon Valley tech utopianism thatâs sweeping the country, it seems to be making everyone I know (and myself) unhappy in really subtle ways, but itâs become almost a cult of sorts. I could turn what I learn about user research to that. But if I want to keep pursuing this path, I have to keep doing the parts that make me depressed (design and coding) for a significant amount of time so Iâve just kind of lost motivation to try at all. I know I should just push through, but Iâve pushed through my whole life and honestly, Iâm tired of fucking pushing. Everyone is telling me to keep moving forward because I show talent in it (the design/code side of user experience) and itâs lucrative but fuck man I can only do this for so long. Iâd rather use my creativity on music or writing. I have three internship interviews this week which isnât good to have hanging over my head when Iâm asking all of these questions. I constantly wonder if there is a better, more fulfilling, and less depressing route to the other side of all of this. The social life issue is more simple, I donât even want to write about it. I need to be more vulnerable to people and go outside my comfort zone, and thatâs gonna take a ton of work no matter how you spin it. The first part of this video with James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem is basically my entire life in a nutshell: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYCz06bS380. Ditto on the dating life, although that might be a little more complicated. Iâve only even felt attracted to one person since my breakup, so I guess there is more going underneath the surface there. I canât imagine dating anyone in my current state, but man, the ever-present loneliness really drains me. Isnât it ironic though? I want to go into a career where I study people all day, yet I struggle to actually build and establish friendships. Iâm like a peopleâs introvert, it makes no sense. I seem to use daydreaming and fantasizing as an escape. I spend an embarrassing amount of mental time

"Things that I liked about today so far **Maybe the only way to escape depression is gratitude. Cicero, one of the senators of Rome in the early days of the empire is quoted to have said ""Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others."" I liked waking up early and going to the gym on an intense pre workout. I like stepping outside in the cold to smoke and feel the warmth when I re-enter the building. I like seeing the trees trying to survive the winter, how splendorous they are. In them I see people going through hard times and the beauty that exists within them. I liked logging on to Runescape to escape reality for a couple of hours and talking to my friends on there. The fact that we have escapes is an amazing thing. I liked seeing three girls meet each other outside and say ""Hiiii how are youuuu?"" and compliment each other. Instead of normally being irritated by that, I actually admired that people in reality share bonds and happiness with each other's presence, and it made me happy to see that. I like the complexity of the mathematics that I'm doing and the fact that I'm doing it. I like having a planned meeting with a group of people today for my class presentation in college. I like having a picture of a God who constantly forgives and is deeply saddened by our unhappiness that becomes to hard to bear for some, versus a picture of an angry Colonel with zero mercy. I like the fact that I have a place to resort to to write down the thoughts streaming from my mind. I like the caprese sandwich I'm eating, with melted mozzarella, tomato, red peppers, pesto sauce.

"Unrequited Love Crept Back Up to Haunt Me First off, I felt the need to create this fake reddit account so that my posts could not be linked to my actual reddit account, and I could vent to reddit without worrying that any of my family or friends will read this. Unrequited love is the worst. It consumes your mind almost every second of every day. I'm usually a positive person (at least I try to be). Grew up with this girl in the church. We were the best of friends. In high school, we went to homecoming and senior ball together. I asked her out 3 times, once in middle school, once in freshman year, and once in senior year, all three times given the response ""I'm sorry, I don't like you in that way."" It messed me up. Even affected my first two relationships. I got with my first girlfriend solely because she liked me. Part of me hoped my best friend would get jealous. I genuinely liked my second girlfriend and she liked me. This girl gave me the butterflies, but because neither of us made a real effort to be boyfriend and girlfriend, we didn't last. Before, after, and sometimes during each of these relationships, I would wish it was my best friend (I know, a dick move). Then I messed up. I was influenced by a terrible person to say some things I shouldn't have. We went to the same community college like we planned but three years passed without ever seeing each other because we were fighting. The time that we spent apart allowed me to clear my head. Before, I used to think about her all the time. Now, days, even weeks would pass without her crossing my mind. I met plenty of people in college and made tons of good friends, focused on my hobbies, it was the happiest I've been. Eventually, we got tired of fighting and I realized what it was that I fucked up: an extremely good friendship. After I made an effort to show how sorry I was, she made an effort to let me back into her life. Then I thought, ""Don't fuck this up. She doesn't need you to like her. She needs you to be a good friend."" I said some harsh things, and because of it, we weren't friends for 2 to 3 years. So naturally, we tried making up for the time we had lost. She invited me to hang with her friends. I invited her to hang with mine. We would do things together, play music together, video games together, and just genuinely hang out. We talked things over and settled our fight by blaming that terrible person that we both dislike from before. We eventually went to the same university together and some of her closest friends became great friends of mine. We took a class together. Would exercise together. And we've gotten to the level of ""No judgment"" as she calls it, where I've told her some of my deepest, darkest secrets, and she did the same with me. Problem is, as we spend each week almost always hanging out 3 or 4 days out of the week. I find it harder to come to terms with us never being together. She's never dated, but she tells me about guys she's liked, little things that happened to her like small romantic contact like ""holding hands"". She has A LOT of guy friends that she's close with, and a few girl friends that she's really close with. And though it only bothered a little back then, it's something I'm jealous of now. Each time I see her, I first think to myself ""be normal, be funny, don't show any signs that you may still have feelings"" and it works. I'm happy with the way things are, us spending lots of time together, hanging out at each other's houses for hours, trying different foods, and just having someone like her I can talk to. But thinking about the guy she who will eventually be her first boyfriend, or her husband whom she may have kids with, that future where another guy becomes the guy she sings with, dances with, goes to church with, does romantic stuff with just pains me to think about. Well, it's late (like 3 in the morning) and this is the time when I'm usually in my feelings. If you've invested time to reading my story this far, I thank you and would like to know what you think about my situation. I'm a bit dramatic, and I overthink like a muthafucka, but I'm an honest fellow, and this is first time venting to reddit. And it's a bit ironic, cuz I should get some sleep since she's coming over tomorrow. P.S. I thought about solutions like slowly drifting apart from her, but I've come to the realization that I would rather have her in my life as a friend than not at all. But it still hurts.

"I wanted to kill myself tonight. I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this, but I've had a very rough few weeks with finding myself jobless, financially struggling and fighting with my boyfriend that I decided to write this little note in my phone. (The ending is supposed to sound funny, it was the only thing that made me laugh and give me that final push thought of pulling myself out of this horrible hole I was in tonight) Tonight, under a drunken wine induced depression, followed by the realization that someone I trust had betrayed it and lack of anti depressants, i seriously considered slitting my wrists in the bathroom. While sobbing with my hands in my face, trying to figure out who would take care of my son and my unpaid debt, I looked up to see my cat staring at me. She has this stern, mothering expression in her eyes, and we locked eyes for the longest time. She kept my gaze until my sobbing was under control and I really thought about my actions. Maybe she just wanted wet food. I am really bad at remembering to take my meds, and usually the day or two where I forget doesn't have this effect on me, but for the pile of emotional shit dealt to me the last week or so, apparently it did. I haven't felt suicidal in years and I just need someone to understand where I'm coming from.

"My mom has changed since marrying her new husband. Iâm a college student, still living at home with my mom, going to school and working part time. I help pay some bills, I help around the house and do errands when I can. Since this new guy moved in with us it doesnât feel like a family anymore. When they do grocery shopping he writes my moms name all over what is HER food. This never happened before and I really never even touched her food to begin with so I find it really rude and unnecessary. When they buy dinner, they bring back food for everyone except me. (My younger brother lives with us too). And they tend to go out to dinner without asking if I want to go. I donât know, Iâm venting but Iâd also like other peopleâs opinions on this.

"Falling back into it I'm 16, and this weekend, I got into a big argument with my girlfriend of 7 months. We hadn't seen each other in 2 weeks, and our plans to see each other fell through. I tried to save our plans, but she seemed disinterested. I was so distraught and caught up in sadness and self-hatred that I, wanting to distance myself from the situation, not just leaving it alone, told her I wanted to break up with her out of sheer emotional irrationality. It turns out I was sadder without her, and she reached out to me to talk soon later. We got back together, and she said she was okay. The way she described the whole situation let me know she understood my plight completely, but I ruined her that day and she's been off ever since. She painted her nails black, screamed at her parents, texted all her friends to tell them how much of a terrible person I was, wrote ""Anon is a piece of shit cunt"" in her bathroom mirror in sharpie, and cried all day from the story she told. I've fallen into a depression of guilt to a magnitude that I haven't experienced since I was a self-loathing near-friendless 7th grader with pent up emotions drowning it all out with video games while tanking his grades, watching the few distant friends get reward after reward, trophy after trophy. I feel like I'm a piece of shit that doesn't deserve to breathe the air on this earth, and I don't know what to do. My parents are very unsympathetic and judgmental and my brother is borderline abusive. My girlfriend is the only one left who understands me. At this point, it's just me who has the problem, as she's gotten over the whole debacle, or so she says. Her mom even said ""ehh, you two were just stressed out teenagers"", but I'm still not convinced. I feel like there's something deeply wrong with me. Is there any advice or words of wisdom that I need to hear? I want to get back to normal. I don't know how I'll deal with feeling completely alone again and losing the people close to me emotionally.

"I just need to get this off of my chest. This is my first time posting. Iâm not sure if trigger warnings are common place here, but before you read on I would like to say warn that this mentions suicide. A family member took their life last week and Iâm really, really struggling. Iâm absolutely devastated that my children wonât be able to grow up with them around. Iâm struggling to keep it all together. I just want to cry all day. But I donât want my kids to see my crying. Everyone around me is just carrying on like normal. I have a history of depression, Iâm currently in therapy and on medication. I feel like my family is wrapping me in cotton wool. When I first found out how it happened, I obsessed over articles that described the process they would have went through while dying. I kept wondering what they were feeling in that moment... if during those last moments they had regret. Then I kept tormenting myself with the âwhat if?â Iâve been able to stop doing those. But now... I just want to be a sloth. I want to sit on the couch and watch TV all day. All motivation I had prior to last week has just gone. Iâve never had anyone this close to me die. A friend who I had grown apart from committed suicide last year. I was upset,.. but I wasnât this upset. Let me stress this - I am definitely not having any suicidal thoughts. Due to the unexpected costs weâve had, I canât afford to see the psychologist, thatâs why Iâm posting here. Iâm just so devastated.

"Dead Mom, Schizophrenic Father. I wrote a 1,900 page message but I figured no one would read it. My mother committed suicide because I left home after years of neglect and emotional abuse. I couldnât go to my father because he has severe schizophrenia and itâs not safe to be around him. I moved across country after my sister who had left a year prior convinced me to do. After I moved across country my sister gave me 2 weeks to get an apartment or sheâd kick me out. I got a job and an apartment (with the help of a really shitty roommate) and I had been working practically trying to just ignoring my previous life. A week ago I found out my mother had killed herself and now me and my sister are back to our old home trying to fix all the problems created by her unexpected (I honestly expected it) death. Iâve left all details out because I could fill a fucking book with them but the main point of this post is, Iâve been fighting all my life for a better life but things always seem to get worse and worse. Iâm at the point where I feel like joining my mother. You can only fight for so long before youâve run out of energy.

"I believe much depression is about a lack of hope 'I don't want to die, I just want to stop existing' Sound familiar? People just want to end the tedium, the suffering of being conscious. But most people would be depressed if not for a goal. I think most people would rather not exist than exist if solely to pick cotton in the sun or mine in poor conditions. But people who are not depressed do these things because there's a goal, a reward afterwards.

I just feel like living with this feeling inside of me is so hard, and maybe genuinely not even worth it. I don't even feel like taking my medicine or eating heathy or anything. I just wake up, go to work, come home and sleep as much as possible. Sorry to rant on here, I'm not sure what else to do.

"I just want to get this off my chest My depression comes and goes, same for my anxiety. The doctor said its that I have an obsessive-compulsive disorder. Somedays I feel fine, others I feel crushing loneliness. I'm 28. Never had a girlfriend and have become distant from my friends. I have no idea of how to meet new people. I just... I dunno, sometimes it feels like I should have my life on track by now. My sisters were married at this point, meanwhile, I never had an intimate relationship nor even a small idea of how to start one. I see people with successful careers, homes, families at my age, yet I feel like I'm just going day to day growing older with nothing to look forward to. I don't want to kill myself but sometimes I wish I just ceased to be. My hobbies don't feel fulfilling any longer and sometimes I just want to sleep the morning away mainly to make the day shorter. I can't even force myself to enjoy parties because I feel this pressure on the back of my neck and after a while and it becomes unbearable. I need to leave to feel better and yet I feel worse in loneliness. I don't know.

"My brother has depression and I need help Iâll start off by saying Iâm not sure if this is the right place to say this and if it isnât, Iâd love if you could point me in the right direction. My brother has a multitude of things such as depression, anxiety and anger issues. Recently he has been going to IOP (canât exactly remember the name, but itâs a step below inpatient care) at a facility and he has shown some progress. I feel like heâs more in touch with how he feels and is working on coping mechanisms better. However he did not go to his session today and that caused problems. He got his check from work today and it would not get deposited, and that set him off into a fit. He started breaking things and getting in both mine and my parents faces, cussing and attacking us. We had a conversation after and he said he tells himself the thing we tell him, such as how he needs to be more rational and more committed to getting better. He also eats unhealthy and is overweight, and Iâve attempted to help him get healthier about a month ago, but he stopped listening to me about. I love and care for him deeply but our family is at our wits end with what to do. I would want to leave him be and let him sort his issues out without us harassing him about it but when he gets violent and angry around the house we canât sit idly. Iâm not sure what the next step is but Iâd love to hear advice from anyone. Thanks for listening.

"Unstuck yourself I used to be stuck in negative mood and had suicide plan at one point. I didn't see the point of doing anything nor meaning of life itself. One day a light bulb went off. I realize the world is much bigger than any of us could see or imagine from our corner at a given time. We shouldn't refuse to do things just because we don't understand the point. Instead we should celebrate the gift we are given. Just go do things because we CAN! If you are lonely, go talk to a homeless person. You will be surprised how much you could learn. If someone did you wrong at one time, forgive them and live for the future. Life has so much for us to explore. The trick is to start on one thing. Put left foot before right foot, then next ... You will feel better soon once you stop feeling by start doing.

"Am I being a bad friend or is she? Hey, I'm kind of new to Reddit but I kinda need an opinion on a situation and I really hope the person I'm talking about never reads this. I have this close friend, (let's call her P) and lately, P and I have been having some problems. P is annoyed because she thinks I don't spend enough time with her. She's in one of my classes so I see her every other day for 2 hours but that isn't enough for her and she wants me dedicate my lunch time to her and spend more time texting her. She gets upset about this to the point where she sends me accusatory/passive aggressive texts during lunch about my location. Now keep in mind, I'm an honors student and I usually have club meetings or classwork to do during lunch periods and I barely see my other friends, who I'm much closer to and don't share many classes with, because of this. I'd be happy to spend time with her in a group of my friends (who she's also friends with) and spend time everyone but she gets mad or upset when I try to talk to my best friends. Also, I don't really like her personality sometimes. She's kind of vain and she flirts with my friends and she likes a lot of guys for simple reasons (i.e. this one guy who's really friendly waves at her every time he sees her in the halls and she had a crush on him for two months because of that even though he wasn't interested). And she always talks about herself and gets jealous of my friendship with the waving guy she liked, to the point where I've stopped talked to him so she doesn't tell me about her dreams in which I make out with the guy in front of her and make her really jealous. However, she cut off most of her ties with her former friend group because they talked behind her back about how she only talks about herself and the current guy she has a crush on. I understand her situation and that she feels like she's losing her only friend but I really don't like being controlled and walked on. I also feel bad about her situation and I don't want her to cry, make me look like a bad person and talk behind my back to my friends/twist the situation (which she has done before) and my friends are either telling me to cut it off with her or that I'm overreacting and a bad friend so I'm posting on here for a second, unbiased opinion. Help?

"Dead is better than alive imo. I wouldnât say I feel particularly sad or depressed, as a constant state. Itâs all over the place. But I think I do want to die. I choose to believe thereâs nothing after we die; no afterlife, no heaven or hell, no reincarnation, or godly ascension. Just a beautiful, peaceful nothing. And it just seems so much better than being alive. When youâre alive, you feel so much. Yes, thereâs happiness, excitement, surprise, love. But thereâs also sadness, anger, hate, jealousy. Why would I chose to bare such things when death can provide none of these things? All the âgood stuffâ about living doesnât weigh out the bad, in my head. A nothingness after death just seems like the better, more rational option. Am I wrong to think this?

"Back pain has brought me to a dark space. Iâve been struggling with back pain for 2 years now and Iâm 17. I play soccer (football), and thats all I know, Iâve played my whole life. I donât have much friends nor other hobbies besides gaming (very mediocre gamer). However, these pass two years have been terrible. Due to my undying love for the sport, I would try to play through the pain. (regret it) Which has only made me worse. I decided my first Summer with back pain that I would not play for a month. Which I achieved with no real results. I passed the time playing Video games. However, the constant sitting probably made my back worse. I played a tournament that same Summer after the month break. 5 games some sort of international tournament. By the end of the tournament my back had gotten so bad I couldnât bear to move. Despite all this, I somehow got chosen to go to Spain. Few months later I went to Spain at 16, with back pain, played soccer and such but didnât get noticed. Fast forward to now and Iâve gone a whole season barley playing and still struggle with back pain. Now Iâm 17, Iâve gone this whole Summer without much activity just stretching and ab work outs. The Summer is almost over and the realization that I havenât gotten better is bringing a dark cloud over me. I scream at night out of anger and sadness. I constantly tell myself I want to die(&lt;-Im not sure if this is breaking a rule, sorry in advanced, just tell me and Iâll remove this part), and I cry everyday. I do most of those things in private, when no oneâs home (excluding the random screaming I do at night). I donât want my mom to worry about me like she does my diagnosed depressed big brother, and also her dealing with my little brotherâs life (Heâs 7). On top of all that my mom is a single mom and barley has time for her own life and gets sad easily. (The sight of my mom sad deeply pains me inside) Iâve always been the one kid that could take care of himself. She has even told me personally that she is glad that she doesnât need to worry too much about me (only deals with my back pain, she takes me to rehab). Iâve been to the Doctors and have done a MRI, they say its nothing. Just functional. (Whatever that means...) Point is, Iâm very sad and I feel like Iâm getting worse everyday. I donât know what to do with my life. The one thing I was good at is now gone. I donât have any other talents or interest.I feel empty without soccer and I donât know how to feel it. TL; DR: Iâve played soccer my whole life, got a back injury two years ago and I still havenât healed. Doctors say its nothing) As a result, I am very sad but I keep it to myself. Iâm not good at anything else.

"Massively depressed and looking for low-cost help Hi there, I am not the type of person to turn to the internet for self-help, but I'm at a loss about what to do and I feel like I have nowhere to turn. I'm 29 y/o F with a history of depression since age 14. I've been on and off about 3-4 different type of antidepressants and in and out of therapy since initial diagnosis, so neither concept is really foreign to me. I'm looking for a low-cost way to talk about my symptoms, even an alternative to real ""talk therapy"". I was in a MSBP-type situation where as a young adult I was forced into therapy when I wasn't ready, and made to discuss what should have been patient protected information with my family after my sessions, so I'm hesitant to ""get into"" that again after the experience. Advice? Help? Anything?

"People I love keep dying. I can't take it anymore. On New Year's Eve I got a phone call at 1 in the morning that one of my closest friends died. I didn't believe it. I thought it was a joke. It wasn't. His brother made a post on Facebook letting everyone know. It felt like a bad dream. I couldn't stop crying. I cried at work. I tried to get time off, but they didn't offer bereavement for people who weren't immediate family. I was so distraught that I couldn't go to the funeral. I was afraid to see his body. I hate myself for being so weak. He was 28. It shouldn't be. He should still be alive. Four months later, my grandfather died. We were close. The last time we talked he said ""that's my sweetheart, that's my pride and joy."" I sat with him in the hospital and watched Aubrey Hepburn. We promised to see each other again soon. I saw him a week later in hospice. He was catatonic. I told him it was okay to let go, okay to move on if he was in pain. They say hearing is the final sense to go. He died thirty minutes after I left. On July 1st my mother told me that she's been diagnosed with cancer. They took a biopsy of her lymph node yesterday to see if it has spread there. She is on a month of leave from work. That was the final straw for me, I think. I feel like a shell of who I was before December 31st. I am terrified of the future. I remember when my friend died, I asked myself who I would lose next. I had no idea things would spiral down and down. Everyday is a struggle for me to stay at work. All I want to do is sleep. I have constant migraines (a chronic condition), and the pain paired with the grief is absolute hell. I started seeing a counselor about a month ago, and I like her but she can only do so much. I am on medication, and I have a good support system. But the sorrow is just overwhelming. I feel like this grief is never going to end. I wasn't ready to say goodbye to them. I don't want to lose my mom. I'm not even thirty. I'm not ready to wake up knowing that she isn't with me anymore. I can't take anymore. I have been crying all day. I don't really know what I expect to see from anyone here, but I'm just so lost.

"I have my ECT consultation today and Iâve never felt more alone. I have a good support system around me but somehow Iâve never felt more alone than at this moment. Nobody else that I know has had depression as severe as mine, or has ever been in this position where the choices are: be miserable forever, or zap your brain which might seemingly cause permanent memory damage and may not even work after all that. Last night was the first time Iâve felt really suicidal in a while (mostly Iâve just been miserable and havenât even been motivated to plan my suicide). Why go through all these awful, invasive treatments when I could just end it quickly and quietly and then everyone else could get back to their lives? I feel like an immense burden. Iâve been severely depressed for the better part of 2 years at this point. It has totally disabled me, robbed me of a career I loved, and made most things difficult or unbearable. Iâve tried 7 different drugs to try and get it and my anxiety under control. No cigar. I donât necessarily want to die, I just donât want to live, if that makes sense. I feel as if my husband, friends, and doctor are keeping me artificially alive with all these treatments that donât work, when in reality, Iâm that painfully sick dog that needs to just be put down already. I never thought the potential for another treatment would actually make me more suicidal, but here we are. Thanks for reading.

"Friend slipping up at work. I talked to her and now sheâs creating a bad environment for me. Iâll call my ex friend Mary. We met at work. I really valued our friendship because itâs hard for me to make friends. I had a few hurt me in the past, so I became guarded. Plus, I had to leave behind true ones when I moved away from my hometown 3 years ago. About a year and a half ago, she started dating a new guy. They seemed to have an ok relationship. After a year of dating, they started having problems. Mary spent every lunch hour complaining about him the entire time. She stopped asking me how I was, always steering the conversation toward her bf. I tried to be there for her, hugging her and reassuring her sheâll be ok. She would be like, yeah I know but...then continue complaining about him. She admitted to nagging him, and he eventually got sick of it and broke up with her. She was a mess, crying at work, sometimes not even coming in. I felt bad for her but it was the same thing over and over all the time, and I ran out of stuff to say. Not to be offensive toward women (I am one, after all), but being the environment it is, word about Maryâs breakup traveled fast, and all our coworkers went up to Mary to comfort her. She leaned heavily on four of them, who often came up to her desk and asked if she wanted to talk. Mary stopped hanging out with me and started spending a lot of time with them. Mary would say yes when they offered to talk to her at work and theyâd talk for like a half hour or longer (my desk is next to hers, so thatâs how I knew). I would also see Mary huddled in the hallways talking to these women a lot. It affected Maryâs work. She started taking on less work (claiming she was overwhelmed) and not being around (she would go off to find one of the women), so the rest of us would be left to answer her calls or speak to her clients on her behalf. Our boss is very hands off and is a poor manager so he has no idea, and my coworkers just excuse Mary because they feel bad for her and donât wanna tell our boss. But because she and I handle certain cases that only she and I know how to deal with, itâs usually me whoâs left to pick up the extra slack. This went on for 3 months. Honestly, if she wasnât a friend, I might gone to our boss, but I decided to talk to Mary about it. It didnât go well. She got defensive, denied that she was slipping up, and accused me of being a bad friend cuz I wasnât there for her during this difficult time. I tried to point out examples of her slipping up and she denied it again. I also told her she wasnât there for me when my friend committed suicide or my dad had a health scare which left him disabled. She just responded that she was left in so much despair from the breakup that she wasnât capable of being unselfish enough to be a friend. We both walked away mad. She started ignoring me completely. I didnât think I was wrong but I still felt bad. As this was around Christmas time, I decided to extend an olive branch by giving her a small Christmas gift and card that just said I was sorry and I hoped she had a merry Christmas. The next day, she said thanks and weâd talk soon. The day after that, she was back to ignoring me. Now she doesnât speak to me or even look at me, just pretends Iâm not there. I canât say for sure, but I get the feeling that she told our coworkers about our conversation (I havenât told anyone at work about it) cuz I now get the cold shoulder from some of them, too, when just the day before, we were all ok. They, in front of me, make a show of hugging Mary and offer food to each other but not to me. I even got a dirty look from one of the women, too. Sigh, I donât know what to do. Any advice?

"My friend is dating my friend's rapist. my friend, let's call her 'b' is very troubled. i've known her for years and she's always had very severe depressive, suicidal and destructive tendencies. recently, it had gotten to the point where our friendship was struggling because it always felt like i had to be looking for her constantly and making sure she wasn't literally running away to commit suicide (and if i wasn't there for her all the time i felt like a bad friend). anyway, she started talking to this boy (let's name him 's') who I knew fairly well for many bad reasons. He was dating b and I's friend (named 'e') for a long period, and tldr, he was extremely abusive and raped her multiple times during their relationship. B was friends with E. Recently, B decided to begin dating S (after lying about meeting him repeatedly over a couple days period). I cut off the friendship but she kept trying to speak to me as I didn;t think she got my point of not wanting to be her friend but I think I've made it more clear in recent messages. It turns out B may have lied about a lot of things (to the point of manipulating me about my trauma, telling me certain people said things about me and didn't like me. she says they definitely said it but the people say otherwise so I don't know who to believe. she has extreme 'stories' that i don't know if are true anymore either). B thinks that me cutting off the friendship is to an extent not fair as it's not my business to make her choose between her now boyfriend and me. I disagree - she is dating our friend's rapist (well not her friend anymore) and I find it disgusting and I can't be friends with her due to this. Mostly, I am paranoid that I am.. well.. wrong. Overreacting, as it's not 100% to do with me - I was friends with him during him and E's relationship but not after I knew of the way he treated her. Do you think I am doing the right thing or should I continue our friendship separately? TLDR: My friend is dating my other friend's rapist. Am I overreacting by cutting off my friendship with her completely?

"I don't know what to do with myself anymore. Last year, I met a wonderful friend online. We began dating in February of 2017 and have been inseparable ever since. However, we both have mental illnesses, for me I have PTSD and depression, and for him ADHD and depression. He's being treated for both, I'm untreated because of my family and our financial situation. I'm afraid I'm frustrating him. I feel like I'm dragging him down. He's tried to get me to take better care of myself, but it's hard, seeing as we're long distance and I always slip back into my bad habits. I feel like I pissed him off tonight and I never understood why he got frustrated, but now I think I do. No matter what, I didn't really listen or heed his advice, and I'm afraid because of that he's going to decide that I'm unmanageable and he'll leave me. I'm terrified I'm going to make him resent me. I'm at my wit's end, he's my best friend and I'm very in love with him, but I just don't know how to be better for him. I'm up at 3 in the morning, school tomorrow, crying because I'm afraid of losing the one person who hasn't given up yet. I don't know what to do.

"How do I end this, or can I fix it? ok, so it's kinda a long story.. but me and my best friend met in high school, we clicked right away, there was this bond ( and kinda still is? ) between us, we would never separate, always talking etc. Still in highschool she cut me out of her life sudendly for a whole year. I dont know why I continue trying to talk to her, but maybe it would have been better for us if it had end there, and eventually she came around and asked to go out with her, we didnt talk at all about that, she just gave me a note saying why she did that, wich honestly didnt tell much except saying she has depression and didnt know what she was doing...She said she always hurts everyone so she cut me out. Years later, we didnt talk that much as before, but were still really good friends, then I started to notice that me or other friends counldn say anything to her if it was something that upset her. Sometimes it was so stupid that she got mad at me because I didnt agree with her opinion over an actor... She would rage in games with everyone, and stop talking.. now the part that hurts me like hell is that she would cut us all out of her life, for like weeks, then come back like nothing happen. She would never tell me whats wrong, if I tried to talk about more serious stuff she would step away again. Eventually I got tired, and told her that we couldnt go on like this. So I stoped talking to her, 2 months later I decided to give another shot, what happen was exactly the same. So I stoped talking again, and I though it was for good, we only talked when we were with all our friends etc. Then I learnt a few months later that she wanted to commit suicide. She actually tried it, said her mom, and was admited to an hospital. I was heart broken, thinking about losing her forever took over my jugdment... So I went to the hospital, and we talk normally. Then after she got out we had a conversation, face to face, about her stoping doing all that to me, she said she was going to try, and promised me, PROMISED ME that she would tell me when something was wrong, or when she would like to be left alone so I didnt worry as much, and that she would talk to me if I ever said something wrong about her. Everything was going great, amazing really. I could tell she was better with her medicine and all, but that only last 3 months. Now she had a problem with a boy she likes or something, pretended that everything was ok, despited her answers said otherwise, and started ignoring me. I was mad and said, some things never change, and she responded to me saying she was a lost cause. I wrote a whole text to her saying I want to be her friend, but that will only work as long as shes honest with me and stops pushing me away... she wanst answered yet. she also never said to me that shes sorry she hurts me, even thoug I say that to her when I hurt her. I feel like Im in a toxic relationship, that I always find my way back in again. Is there a way to fix this? or should I just give up for good?

"My sister wants to have an intervention with our parents about their marriage. So my sister and I are both adults. I'm 29 and she is 26. Neither of us live at home anymore. I have my ~~only~~ own little nuclear family now and she is renovating a house with her long time boyfriend. Since we have been adults we have noticed that our parents marriage isn't exactly happy. Our parents are basically polar opposites. Dad is a really outgoing people person who likes to have lots of activities and friends. However, he is very very emotional and can blow up at the slightest hint of ""disrespect."" If something is wrong it is never his fault, you know the type. Mom is quiet and reserved, not much on physical or verbal affection at all. Her only hobby/activity is through music ministry at our church. My dad joined the church when they got married, but he isn't religious really and only comes on the holidays. Lately my sister has been really distressed by our parents relationship. She is very empathetic and it really upsets her when they fight. So much so, that she does not want to be around them anymore because of it. Today she told me that she thinks we should have some sort of intervention with them about their marriage. My sister and I have discussed before that they probably should really be divorced, but that it will never happen because our mom is Catholic. I think an ""intervention"" would just make it worse because I know my dad will see it as a personal attack. I'm of the ""it's none of my business"" persuasion but I don't want to miss out on family time with my parents and sister. We all get together every couple of weeks at my parents house for dinner and board games, which I love. I don't want to lose that. Any thoughts? Is there anyway to approach our parents without making it worse?

"Losing my Best Friend Ive been best friends with someone for over 11 years now. Not that the amount of time matters but probably helps to understand why im here. Recently i feel very distant from her. We dont talk as often and well this has happened before but before it was as if we never stopped talking when we did message/meet the other again. This time it feels off. I hung out with her about a week ago and after she told me she felt .. awkward .. this totally messed with my mind. She just wasnât comfortable anymore? At this point i dont know what to do. I reach out to her but her schedule gets in the way im afraid this is the end of our friendship. Any advice? P.S Im very open with her, ive communicated this concern to her and there has been no change.

"Is this it? Is this really all there is? There is no escaping the struggle of human existence to just simply die and it's all gone to time? Moments of happiness are fleeting and never last. Pain stays with us for longer. Pain and chaos happen to all people. Suffering is a widespread human emotion. Why do we put on a masquerade amongst each other? Why put yourself through an existence of pain? How many lives have been lived in pain and died in them? Nobody asks for an existence, it's thrust upon you. What you do with it makes you who you are, but what life does to you typically makes you live an existence of either easier happiness or rolling agony. God it's such dirty bullshit.

"Iï¸ owe 31k in student loans, my mom owes 52k in PLUS loans on my education. Iï¸ feel so terrible.. Iâm the first of my 3 siblings to go to college. I got depressed and wasted a year. Now Iâm on my 5th year and I wonât graduate till one more semester in the fall. Iâve been working too but I only make enough to cover some of my living expenses. My school schedule only lets me work around 30 hours a week. My mom has helped me out by taking out Parent PLUS loans for me which she is responsible to repay after I graduate. So far she owes $52k while I owe $31k. I feel so shitty, I canât believe Ive put her through all of this. My dad doesnât work so itâs just her, and my siblings have yet to finish college (one of them is starting in a couple years). Iâm so pissed off at myself, how did I let this happen? If I had my act together I couldâve graduated earlier. I hate myself so much for this, I always prided myself on keeping my mom from harm but sheâs going to be in so much debt. Itâs so unfair, if I had thought this through maybe she wouldnât be in this position. Im so close to graduation but so fucking scared. What if I donât get a job right away? I always said Iâd repay my loans then repay my mom but $52k is so much money. More than Iâve ever seen in my life. Iâm just taking advantage of her at this point.

"Imminent Death of a Loved One So let me start by saying Iâve been fortunate enough to have never lost a family member or really close friend, so this is all foreign to me. My grandpa has had cancer for quite a while and itâs getting worse. Whenever I visit itâs something that is never really talked about and he seems to not really want to talk about it and doesnât really let any of us know what is going on and down plays the situation. Recently Iâve picked up on several indicators that lead me to believe the end is near. I donât really know what the best thing to do is, but I know one thing and thatâs that I donât want to miss any moments, let him down in his last days or regret anything for the rest of my life. He has lived a long and extraordinary life and has so many stories and so much wisdom. One thing is that I want to be able to tell my future kids about him and carry on that legacy after he passes and there are many stories that I canât myself recite and many that I am sure that I havenât even heard. I guess what Iâm looking for is maybe someone who has gone through this sort of thing and can share maybe some things that they did or wish they wouldâve done before their loved one passed away. Two things kind of come to mind but I donât know how to bring it up. Maybe to have him write some things down in a journal or to record something. Iâm also just open to hearing anyone elseâs stories. Thanks in advance

"Unreturned texts An old college dorm friend who started organizing reunions I saw twice last year with other former classmates has not responded to my last two texts including a Holiday greeting to him and his family-- which I consider rude. I made it a point to keep in touch with people especially during the holidays. Am tempted to zap this person and drop him but my wife says to let it slide. I would not say we are close but am perplexed at the rudeness of not even mustering a reply to a holiday greeting even if its fake. I've done nothing to this person except it came out during our last group get together that I went on to get a law degree at an elite school. I never even discuss careers or money at these things if that is the reason. Baffling.

"Am I being too harsh? I have a cousin(we'll call him Joe) who is the closest thing I have ever had to a best friend. We used to do everything together. Throughout the years we would party our asses off in college, spend holidays together, play video games; literally everything together. About a year ago, I started to notice that he was making some bad life choices. Particularly, these bad choices involved drinking and driving, pushing relationships away, and hanging out with the wrong type of people. At first, it didn't really affect our friendship. We've always respected each others separate lives when we weren't hanging out. It was when I started to notice the changes mentioned above that I started to bring it up. One weekend, the whole friendship imploded. Some of my friends were coming into town. Joe was friends with them as well, so I was planning a great time for all of us. Friday, we went out to a local bar and were all having fun. Joe has a girlfriend, who wasn't able to join us until the following Saturday morning due to work obligations. They had been dating for about 3 months, and Joe had been constantly pushing her away, pretending he didn't care about her when I thought she was a stand up gal that could really help him. That Friday night, Joe ends up making out with an ugly, fat, unnattractive old acquaintenance of ours. I confronted Joe and told him to cut the shit or I would knock his ass out. He stopped messing around with the girl and pretended everything was fine. I confronted him, calling him out for how he chooses to make his life miserable with his actions. I forced him to tell his girlfriend what he did. After sending the text, he drove home drunk from the bar. The next day, Saturday, my friends, Joe, and I all met up at a local event in my hometown. Joe apologized to me and said he was glad I was there to make things right. I forgave him and we proceeded to have a great time at the event(which is basically just a big tailgate party). Near the end of the day, Joe's girlfriend was finally able to show up and join the festivities. She didn't seem bothered by his actions of the previous night, which made me happy because Joe needed someone like her in his life. Well, as the evening continued, Joe wouldn't stop drinking. I kept telling him to take it easy, but it was in his head that he wanted to keep the party going at any rate. That evening, Joe ditched me and everyone in the group, including his girlfriend, to go to the bars with some random people he met at the local event. We were all there together, and then he disappeared, gone without a trace or text. He told his girlfriend to wait in a near by parking lot while he finished partying. She ended up calling me, crying, asking me to help her find him. I tried to call Joe multiple times, and was ignored and sent to voicemail. At this point, I'm full of rage from his actions now and the night prior. Why would he treat me, his ""best friend"", and his girlfriend like this? I text him, saying how upset I am and that he needs to be a man and figure his life out becuase he's pushing those closest to him away. Later that night(around 2AM), I get calls from people at the local event that know me saying that he is making out with random chicks again and eventually was arrested by the police. They're telling me to come get him before the police take him to jail. I refuse. Turned out he didn't actual get arrested(so he claimed), I've never found out the truth of that night. It's been over a year since I've talked to him. I don't answer his calls or reply to his texts. When I go home to my local town, he always texts me and says he wants to come over and visit or that he wants to meet up. He pretends that his actions didn't completely ruin our friendship. I demand that he holds himself accountable and changes his lifestyle. I won't respond to him until he has acknowledged how he has acted and makes an attempt to fix the problem: drinking alchohol and pretending we(closest people in his life) mean nothing to him. My question: Am I being too harsh? Treating him like this breaks my heart. He was my best friend, we had promised to be each other's best men in our weddings. I don't know any other way for him to recognize how awful of a person he has become and to help him learn that he can't live his life like this.

"I Just Want to Feel Normal Iâll try to make this as short as possible, I swear.... And please bear with me. I know this is overwhelming and a lot is jumbled, but I have no other outlet.... Iâm so tired of living. Iâm not suicidal by any means, and Iâm not talking about ending my life or anything, but Iâm so TIRED of living in the mental state that Iâm in. I canât afford a therapist, and the ones that have been recommended because they work with your income are awful.... My depression didnât hit until after my first child was born almost three years ago. Since then, I have been a WRECK, but have gotten much MUCH better over the course of the years. Iâve been on Celexa (60mg) for about a year which helped tremendously, but had to do away wth it once I hit my third trimester of this pregnancy (Iâm currently 21 weeks). ALL OF THESE SYMPTOMS happened before I got pregnant a second time, and have been intensified since becoming pregnant... âIâm constantly moody. My emotions change with the drop of a hat. âIâm constantly wondering why my husband stays with me (he is a GREAT GREAT supporting, caring lover) and am always thinking he deserves better âI hate waking up on the weekends because I feel like I have no purpose (my almost-three year old is pretty easy to manage despite being rambunctious) âI am too self conscious to even get out and do something if I know the place I want to go to will be crowded âI have NO motivation to do anything. Walking to get some fresh air? Nope. Getting out of the house just for a moment to change scenery? Not a chance. âEverything that I try to do I have NO attention span to continue. Ive tried reading, cross stitching, writing, adult coloring books, ANYTHING to make my life seem more interesting and pleasurable....and I just canât stick to anything. Iâm sorry. I know this post is all over the place. I donât even know where to start. I just wish that I had SOMEONE to talk to to set me straight Nd to encourage me. My husband tries his best and he does a GREAT job, but he has no idea what it feels like....

"Is this kind of family interaction normal? Hi all, I hope you can help me out. Is what my dad said to me normal? Backstory: I'm 24f...married...have a toddler. I was texting my mom today about several things (husband can get ribs on sale at work for them, MIL invited me and my mom to a play, things my MIL said that irritated me...etc. She was on break at work). At the end, she mentioned my dad is home sick today. Maybe I should call him. So I call him and ask him jokinging why he's sick. He said he has the flu or a cold or something. He stayed home yesterday too. Then he mumbled something offhand about how mom wasn't going to tell me because I never ask them how they are. Do normal parents do/say stuff like that? Won't tell their kid that one if them are sick because they don't ask how they are? It makes me feel terrible but also manipulated. It's not like my mom has never given me the silent treatment because she thinks I don't call enough. The thing is...I HATE small talk. I never ask anyone how they are. It feels fake and wrong to me(maybe because I don't think most people actually care about me). They(anyone) can tell me if they don't feel good. I wouldn't wait til asked to tell my close family/friends if I don't feel well. I also have social anxiety and anxiety in general. These kinds of comments make me want to call them even less. I already feel judged every time I call my mom. And I still get anxious every time my dad calls...thinking he is calling to yell or something. I just CAN'T ask. It literally feel impossible. Like I physically can't get the words out. Comments? Anything to make feel better? I feel down and don't like myself. I don't have any friends to talk to about it either.

"I just really need to vent... For a start, I understand everyone in life are at different levels and that depression and anxiety is different for everyone and I am in no way stating who has it worst or better. Iâve taken hours and hours of training in it and Iâm not here to speak or preach about how to help.. In a rare occasion in my life Iâm asking for help, guidance, I donât know the correct word but maybe if I explain myself a bit it may help. This maybe long and I do apologize but I just need to say all of this SOMEWHERE... Iâm gay guy that recently moved from a conservative town in Montana to the amazing city of Portland, OR. I came out of the closet the summer going into my freshman year of high school, dealt with a (simply put) shitty childhood while growing up in the Bible Belt of northern Florida, with an abusive father and worrying, even at the age of 7/8 about how my future would play out in this. My mom divorced and remarried a man that doesnât accept my sexuality personally but supports my life decision and says he loves me. We moved to Montana (my mom, me and him) and I began to feel like I did have a purpose when I was introduced to acting onstage at a local theatre that I fell in love with. Life, for a few years, was amazing but my high school at the time was having a crisis. Unfortunately four students had committed suicide between my freshman and junior year and, with the help of many, started a suicide awareness program in the city and lead that for a year or so. My senior year, literally three days before it started, my military brother committed suicide on base, it was suspected it was also his sexuality. But also in my senior year, near the end of it, I met a man whom I fell in love with (which is what I am getting too, just bare with me). We were able to spend a lot of time together for a month or two before he had to leave to Portland (before I had gone) for a work internship where he would go back home to Brazil once completed. He treats me like gold, and I really mean that, he has been nothing but amazing to me. He flew me out to Portland so I could visit him for two weeks where we fell even more in love. Everything was shattered when he left for home and I also left for an adventure. After I graduated, I had the amazing opportunity to go to the BEAUTIFUL island of Taiwan, where I spent an amazing year learning Chinese (Mandarin), meeting people all around the world, experiencing a new culture for the first time, it was indeed a life changing time for me. But it wasnât easy for my boyfriend and I. We fought in occasion, texting makes it really hard to communicate emotions, and we only had about two hours out of our days to talk due to the harsh time zone differences. The year went by quite quickly and he surprised me with yet another plane ticket to Portland where he would also land only two hours after I did and we would be together again. It was only for two weeks again but I felt complete... He even proposed on the Fourth of July. He was yanked away from me again soon after and it tore me down. My heart crumbled. My next chapter in life had started once I arrived back from Taiwan and had seen my boyfriend again. I had decided I wanted to move to a Portland permanently, found a decent student housing apartment, enrolled for school, I was excited... now this is where things become a bit much for me and why Iâm here today. My, now fiancÃ©, was able to stay with me for a full month this time. Now at this point Iâm sure you wonder (if you are still reading), âwhy doesnât he move here?,â or âwhy donât you move there?â Hereâs why: He was on an exchange program when I met him that the Brazilian government paid for. The requirement for that visa is that he must stay in Brazil for two years before he can legally move back into the USA. In other words, he is stuck there while Iâm stuck here both separated and both in fear of him being rejected. We applied for the fiancÃ© visa and now we are waiting for the approval. I refuse to move where he lives because of how high the crime rate is and due to Brazilâs economic status, we both agreed it would not be good for a white American target to live in a high crime area. I know I have talked a lot about my fiancÃ© but here is also what is going on on my hands as well that I just was not ready for. Before I moved to Portland, I had to go to urgent care because I had no primary doctor and no money, only Medicaid, which they took. I went three times for small bumps on my hands that turned out to be stressed induced and all three times I went the doctors said âI have no idea! Try using lotions and see what happens!â Nodded their heads and left. Very pointless but when I got the bill I was shocked and confused. I thought my Medicaid had covered it, which it did not because while I was out of country my Medicaid had expired and no one told me about it, therefore I was left with a $600 bill. I heard it off for a while because I had other things to deal with than the bullshit that the hospital was giving me about it. Around this time as well,

"I'm a [M/17] A guy and I both know each other but never spoke a word, how can I approach him. Before telling you about my problem that I seek advice for, let me tell you about my personality. I don't have any real friends, I just have acquaintances, if you will, people who I see in school mostly and spend some time with occasionally, I find myself to be happier this way since I could focus more on what I like most (Science and music) I basically spend a vast majority of my time alone even when I go out to the cinema or to get dinner I have no one but myself, I was like this since I was a kid, so due to this my social skills aren't great, I turn red most of the times when I speak to new people and just wish I'd turn into a tree just so I could escape the situation. However, I can speak on a stage in front of thousands of people if I had to, as long as it is not a direct interaction or I already know the people I'm speaking with, I am good. With that said, over the past year, I found myself trapped in a social situation beyond my understanding, I genuinely don't fully understand how this relationship (If you could call it that in the first place) developed in the first place but here is a recap of what happened. A little bit over a year ago in my school. Some guy and I sat around the same table in the library, this happened because the library was packed that day and there was no other place other than that table, so we just sat opposite to eachother not saying a word, and I'm pretty sure each one of us didnt know that the other existed in the first place, days went by and everyday I went to the library I'd sit in the same place and the same goes for him, even when the library was completely empty we'd sit in the exact same place, by this time we knew eachother but never spoke a single word I guess we got used to eachother and if a day went by without one of us being there I'm pretty sure we'd feel a bit blue. By the time we were done with our exams we stopped coming to the library and did not see each other that often until our classes got moved and my homeroom happened to be just opposite of his, and this is where the bollocks started, we got to see one another way more often, In the corridor, the bathroom, on the way out to the buses, and as we passed by eachother, we'd always just stare at eachother still not speaking a single word, we both know eachother but pretended that we didn't. We would find our selves in group conversations since we have mutual friends, we still wouldn't directly speak but if I say a joke he's going to laugh and vice versa. I developed some kind of liking for this guy, I almost consider him to be a friend although we never spoke, I'd like to say hi, but as I said before I will probably turn so red that I'd melt, and even if I was courageous enough and had the social skills to do so I don't even know if he wants to talk maybe he doesn't like me or consider me a friend, maybe I'm just an obnoxious kid he sees way too often. Now we see each other every day in the morning, I don't know how the hell it happens but we go to the restroom at the same exact time in the morning (I guess we both arrive at the same time). So this is a short version of what happened, this is bugging me and I've been losing sleep over it, what do I do? Sorry for the long post and rubbish grammar (English isn't my first language) Thanks in advance.

"Advice Please I've been in a relationship with a woman for some time now, and it's becoming serious enough that marriage is a certainty. She has a son from her previous marriage, seven years old. Her previous husband, however, was very controlling and abusive. Her son has a lot of behaviour issues as a result. He constantly swears (""fuck, shit, cunt, etc"", just to show how extreme), he's violent a lot, throwing things across the room, he's constantly screaming and shouting, no concept of manners. He'll shout ""give me food now"". His mother, as a result of the cruel treatment she got from her husband, is too scared to stand up to him. He clearly has anger issues bordering on clinical. He'll often have breakdowns with fits of anger. She lives with her parents. While they have the best of intentions for their grandson, her mothers treatment of her is vile. She's cruel and demeaning. She constantly undermines her confidence and authority, saying she's stupid and doesn't know what she's doing in front of her son, and then, stupidly, complains that she get her son to listen to her. She regularly swears. She loudly gossips about everybody, complaining about with violent undertones. And to make it worse, she often threatens calling social services on her. Personally, I doubt she would, as she got far more incriminating evidence against her than her daughter. But either way, he would be taken from both of them. So, yeah..... a bit complicated. No idea what to do. As it's very likely that I'll become a step father to this child, I was wondering what advice people could give, or direct me to somewhere that could help. Thanks

"That eternal slumber Iâm tired. Iâm not here to be saved. Iâm nearly 40: have a career, a SO, friends &amp; family who care for me but it will never be enough to keep me around. Iâve been depressed since age 8, my first suicide attempt was at 11 and Iâm convinced my life will end by my own hand eventually. Iâve lurked here but never posted. I had to reach out somehow and was not going to call or text the goddamn crisis line. The world sees me as happy and outgoing even when Iâm honest about my depression b/c I donât SHOW it to anyone. Iâm lonely. Iâm tired. Iâm not sure how much I have left to give. I try. I do. I wake up &amp; try to be positive, make the most of each day but Iâm just going through the motions. That sirenâs song has been stronger these past few weeks. Tonite ended with me locked in the bathroom, sitting on the floor in a fat, disgusting, pathetic crying heap - razor blade in hand. One of my cats scratching at the door &amp; me trying to hush her so as not to wake my SO. Through the tears I pathetically sliced away at my inner leg a few times. Been a decade since Iâve cut. No relief. Thereâs no point to any of this, no ultimate conclusion. Iâm not looking for advice or friendship, I just needed someone out there to know how desperately I long for that final sleep.

"Iâve lost the last of my hope for âmy turnâ. I (24M) think that without making the conscious decision to, Iâve given up. I think Iâve just reached the point where Iâve stopped kidding myself that itâll all âget betterâ or âwork out somedayâ like people always tell you. What I canât seem to shake is the faint screaming in the back of my head trying to get me to fix everything, the one who still believes happiness is possible despite my entire existence thus far indicating otherwise. I work at a job in an office doing pointless work that I used to swear to myself in high school and college that Iâd never wind up doing. 5 days a week I wake up at 7, leave at 7:30, work from 8-5, and get home (at my parentsâ house) at 5:30. Then I eat dinner with them, watch TV with them, and they go to bed, so I turn in at 9, watch more TV, and go to bed myself. On the weekends I typically do nothing. When I do go out or hang out with a friend, we do nothing, just sit and watch TV or a movie. Unless we can find some fictional world we can discuss (Marvel, GoT, Star Wars, etc) we donât even have much to talk about. I maybe have 2-3 friends that I do this with, and again, not too often. I do not currently have, nor have I ever had, anything even resembling a love life. I was foolishly in love with a close friend who felt nothing for me thru high school and most of college before I managed to stop kidding myself on that one. Iâve never had sex with or even kissed a girl. The closest thing I ever did was cuddle with a really close friend, and I even fucked that up because I overthought everything as always and didnât make a real move, and she instantly lost interest/gave up on me, and now weâre barely even friends anymore. Iâm an introvert with no desire to change. I have no interest in going out to bars, clubs, or anything people my age for some reason enjoy. All I want is a person to love and spend my time with and provide each other with the human contact we need. My idea of the perfect evening would be cuddling on the couch with a girl I love and watching Netflix, just enjoying the closeness, maybe some kissing. Sex is something I want but not even on my radar right now. My life goals can be summed up in saying I want to find my âpersonâ have a kid or two, and do what I can to make them and myself happy. I just honestly donât see the path to that reality, though. Nothing matters to me anymore. Just my parents, and I can honestly say that I am 100% safe as long as theyâre around because I care more about them than myself. However, if they were gone tomorrow, I think Iâd be close behind. I just donât see a path out of this pointless existence that I feel capable of taking. I feel like Iâm just serving a sentence, going through the motions until itâs mercifully done. No question really. I just felt the need to say it and acknowledge that Iâm done. With everything. TL;DR: Iâm done, burnt out. Lifeâs never been good to me and Iâve stopped expecting âmy turnâ. I see no way to achieve the few things in life I want.

"Is my dad enabling my mom? I have posted on multiple subs about my turbulent relationship with my mom, and I feel like I am afraid of her. I've gotten to a point where I jump when the garage door opens and she comes home from work. I think have become so irrationally afraid of my mom, that fear manifested today when I was going to pick my brother up from work and saw my mom coming the other way. I freaked out and ended up rear-ending another car, totaling mine (I am not hurt, don't worry.) Needless to say, this whole situation has caused chaos in my house and I am terrified to ever get behind the wheel again. Tonight my dad called me out on me calling my mom ""abusive"" a few weeks ago. Bear in mind, neither she nor my dad has ever laid a finger on me, but my mom has emotionally abusive tendencies. She has said things to me that have fucked me up more than she can understand. Here's a short list of some things she's done: * If guilt tripping were an Olympic sport, let's just say she'd be Michael Phelps. * She likes to ask me what's wrong when I'm upset and when I tell her, she cuts me off and says ""I don't want to talk about it."" * She has criticized my weight for as long as I can remember. In her defense, her two sisters are 500 pounds apiece will both probably die before they reach 60, so she just wants me to be healthy and live long. But she's not helping. She's only making me want to cry into a Chipotle bowl. * She liked comparing me to my best friend in high school (""Why can't you be more like her? She studies and gets good grades!"") Still does sometimes. * To this day, she pesters me about my lack of religion. I remember when I was 11 and didn't want to go to Sunday School, she was like ""Do you want to be a heathen and go to hell?"" A couple years ago, she told me ""I just want you to go to Heaven when you die."" She even pestered me a week ago about having demons in my head. * I thought I could confide in her about my sexuality but she quickly shot me down with ""How do you know? You've never been on a date before. That doesn't mean you're bi/gay!"" She also told me I am asexual and she's pretty much gaslighted me about my sexuality to the point where I don't know whether I am gay or straight anymore. * I was diagnosed with Aspergers and ADHD when I was a kid and she's basically used that diagnosis to keep me in a little bubble. I didn't get drivers' license until 18, didn't get my first job until 20, and I'm still perpetually single... all because my mom has used my diagnoses as a crutch. She still does, and after the accident, I don't fucking blame her! Whenever I try to tell him about the things my mom says, he says things like ""What's wrong with motivating you to get better grades?"" or ""Your mom doesn't want you to end up like your sisters that she is going to bury because they're 500 pounds."" My mom is my bully, and he is her apologist. I don't how much of this (if anything) constitutes abuse, but my dad doesn't buy any of it and blames it on ""liberal millennial indoctrinated safe-space snowflake bullshit... abuse is broken bones, black eyes and cigarette burns on arms."" He goes on about how he and mom have done everything for me and how there is something in my sick, twisted mind that is confusing ""constructive criticism"" with ""abuse."" Deep down, I am beginning to resent my parents, because they *have* done everything for me, sheltered me and spoiled me to the point where I don't know how the world outside my little bubble works. I am 23 now and don't feel any better off now than I did when I was ten years ago. There are certain life skills I don't have because they did everything for me. I don't feel like I've ever had to work for anything and I hate them for it. They tried to be tougher with me but didn't have the spine. They never forced me to do anything except go to summer camps for special needs kids, they pretty much just let me raise myself and it's costing all of us dearly. Tonight is the night my real life begins. Basically, if I am so afraid of my mom that seeing her on the road freaks me out to the point of an accident, something in our relationship has gone south. I don't know if it's her or me anymore.

"My Wifes Car, Money, and My Brother. What do I do? My wife and I got married, but instead of an engagement ring, we decided I would buy her a car instead. I brought the Toyota and moved in. She already owned another Honda. This way we would have 2. Eventually, she gave her Honda to her brother (who was also in need), and I told her she could give it to him because her dad had initially bought the Honda anyway, not her, so he has every right to own that Honda especially since we had 2 at the time. Keep i mind that it was ultimately my decision, not hers, to let him have the car, because although I'm married to her and her dad bought her the car, I felt like since her dad ""bought"" it, he has the right to it, and since her brother is her dads ""male"" descendant, he has the right to the car. (Sorry we're an asian family) So now we have 1 Toyota (the engagement ring car). With a baby on the way, we decided we would lease another Nissan ourselves, so we could have 2 cars again. Recently my brother was involved the Caribbean island Hurricanes where he goes to Med School, and his whole semester was shifted back to America until either this August or December. So now he's also in need of a car for about 8-9 months. I told my wife that since we are leasing a Nissan, we can let my brother borrow our current Toyota for the time being. My wife doesnt want to give up the Toyota to him in fear that she will lose it. I thought this was unjustified because she gave her Honda to her brother, so why can't I let my brother borrow the Toyota too? Both of us grew up believing in ""helping"" a person in need, and I feel like I went out of my way to let her brother have a car that was rightfully hers, but she didnt let me do the same when it came to my brother. But then again, I feel like she does have a right to the Toyota because it was a replacement for an engagement ring at the time. After her brother took the Honda, we have been using 1 car for the last year. I figured we could keep using 1 car for another 8-9 months if it means saving my parents some money in buying my brother a different car. Am I wrong here? Is she technically right? Am I unreasonable because what we do with the car should be my wife's decision, since it was a replacement for her ring?

"Am I in a bad friendship? I have this friend and he's actually really fun and quite an extrovert. He's cheerful most of the time. But the thing is he has anger issues and he gets pissed off at people and stuff easily including me. Whenever i play games like league of legends with him he gets so mad at me for stuff that i didn't even do and even at one point filed a complaint and wrote stuff that was completely false about me. And I used to ask him questions sometimes via text and he'd always respond but then he'd say ""you could've at least said hi"". So one time i just said a simple hi to him and you know what? he said ""I'm really not in the mood for a pointless hi"" and he seemed really moody to me especially for some reason and then he typed something ""you know i really dont know why you bother..."" i couldnt read the rest because he deleted it. But whats weird is he still wants to play league with me and stuff which i find stupid because i know hes just gonna get angry at me again and only me. he never gets angry at anyone else he plays with in that game and it makes me feel sick. So i just stopped messaging him in general. and one time he said ""you know i dont know why im so aggressive to you so lets just forget that happened"" and i didnt say much and he said ""i know you dont have much to say and i dont care so lets just forget"". He didnt even say sorry for being so mean to me. To me it just looked like someone that was trying to clean up the pile of junk he left so he doesnt need to think of it later. It makes me feel so sick to think of. And sometimes he calls me a bitch and a hoe. Like really? Why would you call your friend that? I never called him anything like that. One time he was trying to talk to me and a bunch of other people were talking over him so I couldn't hear him. Then he said ""yo bitch"". I really wanted to punch him in the face that was really hurtful like I have a name cant you at least say my dam name? Sometimes I just hate him so much and its sad because hes a fun person but he just gets stupidly pissed off and says whatever he wants without thinking how hurtful or rude it is.

"Should i bother what best friend think about me? I feel like garbage, i have no friends. When im with others, i try to be interesting, and funny, never harm others or depress others with sad stuffs. I think with friends you can loose up and be yourself. But my BEST friend have something problem with me. I think he dont like who i am, how i behave. Sometimes he notices something about me. What i should have said, or done...like a mother see how her children behave. There was time when he bashed me because i was silent, or because i asked a question about our mutual FRIEND. This weekend we would held a little surprise party to our friend but he said to me, behave and be nice. If i was wrong or bad. Nobody ever told me if i said, done something wrong. Never. He every time say something. He is very sumbissive to others, always go after others. And if he dont like someone, he always talks behind his/her back to me. He has friends i dont. And i feel a sack of ... because of this. I starting to have enough about how he wants me to behave within FRIENDS and pushing this ""you are bad"" feeling to me. I think this is not friendship, he is not my friend. If you are friend with someone, you like him/her who the person is. If i cant be myself within friends, i cant be myself elsewhere. Stepped back from this party, and said im sick. This weekend felt bad because of him. What should i do? (Sorry aim not english, my grammar is bad)

"I just told all 100 students I teach I have depression in an email about finals week I'm an undergraduate TA at a university, in an interdisciplinary class about the brain. I absolutely love being a TA, but admittedly this quarter it has been a struggle mentally, I often feel anxious that I am doing a horrible job. I sent out this email to all 100 of my students about finals: Hi everyone, These next two weeks will be a really, really tough time for all of you. I know how incredibly hard you all have worked this quarter, and how hard you will push yourselves during this final stretch, but there are 2 other things I want you to know: 1) I, the other TAs, and our professor will not be disappointed if you do not perform as well you want, so you shouldn't be either. Tests and grades are not always the best reflection of you as students/scientists, and they are most certainly are not a reflection of your worth as a person. All a test assesses is how much content you remember and how well you can take a test at a certain time on a certain day. It is simply one data point, and as you should all know by now, 1 data point is not representative of the population. For many of you, you have other finals/presentations/responsibilities going on, and it'll be difficult to find time to study. For others, you may want so badly to study a lot, but can't because you are so stressed and anxious. I personally deal with anxiety and depression, and I know how utterly frustrating it is when your mind doesn't work as well as you want it to. 2) Take care of yourself. Eat good food, get some sleep, spend time with people you love. So, while you prepare for finals these next weeks, keep these two things in mind. You are all incredibly curious, kind, intelligent and important people. I brag all the time that I get to work with the most amazing group of students who bring unique and valuable contributions to this class everyday, and inspire me to be the best TA I can possibly be. Cheering you on!! ~austen1996 (I can't believe I just told all my students about my mental illness, but it honestly feels so liberating to do so. It also feels so hypocritical of me to send this, because I attribute much of my self-worth to academics and don't practice much self-care.....but I felt like this needed to be said).

"I'm going to the party Awhile back I was out drinking with my aunt. She decided to tell me a"" huge family secret"" that my father was murdered by the guy my mom dated after he died. And that my mom was complicit. That my gramma and uncle , both dead now believed this too. That some doctor at the hospital said he looked as if he had been beaten to death. This pissed me off and confused me greatly since my mother can't speak up for herself. She died 7 yr's ago. My aunt wasn't even there when my dad died in front if all us kids and my mom from an aneurysm when I was 2. This explains a lot about how I always felt me and my mom were outcast by my dad's family over the years. Yes my mom was a hippy and my dad's family didn't approve of her since she already had 4 kids when they married. Yes after he died she dated one of their mutual friends, who was black which they also disapproved of. That night riding my bike home from the bar I was crying and so confused praying to my mom and dad why would she say this to me? So i called my big sister/ best friend who calmed me down saying no, she was there, he wasn't murdered, my aunt just talking shit. My aunt called me next day asking me not to tell my siblings what she said. She said she was afraid the suspected murderer might come after her?! Anyway by that time it was too late , but i didn't tell her that. I promised not to tell. I shouldn't have lied but the whole thing was just so bizarre I couldn't keep it to myself. My brother messaged her on FB that she was wrong, that he was there and saw everything , my dad was not murdered. The fact she would say that about my mom really upset all of us. Well since my brother messaged her, my aunt and my cousins completely ghosted me and my kids over the holidays and everything. Before then we were close travelling together and going to events and parties all the time. My kids don't get it. Where is auntie they say , can we go visit? I just say she's busy. So yesterday my cousins ex posted about a birthday party for her 3 yo son. I msgs her me and my 4 and 7 yo would like to go. She said sure sorry she forgot to invite us. So now I'm about to go and see all of them for the first time since all the bs. Im nervous but I know it's the right thing to do. Give me strength mom and dad!

"Options for helping my sister in law Initially I wrote out a very long post with all the problems my SIL is dealing with but it really all comes down to this question: With my 13 y.o. sister in law living in really terrible conditions (think 1 step above homelessness compounded by emotional abuse from parents and bullying at school), are there any options for my wife and I to effectively 'adopt' her for an extended period of time? Do we have *any* course of action that would give us rights to house her over her divorced parents?

"Living At Home With Untrustworthy Family Member This post may be a bit long, but I really need advice , outside of the obvious ""just move out"" , which I will be doing soon, but I need advice for until I do. So I live at home with an untrustworthy uncle who has shown me that I can't trust him. He talks about people behind their back, personally talks down to me, purposely does things to hold me back (such as will place a setback in my way knowing it will affect my moving out --- he asks me to drive someone somewhere using my car during the time I have to be at work, ect.) . Anyway, my uncle wants me to contribute to the household by paying $50.00 towards the electric bill. So I go, ""Ok, no problem."" That is a big problem because I was initially thinking I could go to a bill payment center and just directly pay it there as my debit card company (AMEX, Visa, ect) isn't accepted by the electric company. I called the electric company and was told if I go to a billpayment center that I need the bill or at least the account number. I have neither and am unable to access either because my uncle takes the bill . I have asked to see it, both asking my aunt and uncle. My aunt says ""I am trying to complicate things,"" and informed me that my uncle pays everything via his bank account,which really means to ""contribute"", I am really having to pay my uncle $50 after he pays the whole bill from his bank account. I don't want to do that because I am looking at having to give him that $50 , which is really going in his pocket, versus to the electric company, as a waste of money. I want to be sure my money is going where it is supposed to go (to the electric bill, and not in my uncle's pockets). When my sister lived here, they let her have access to the bills and pay them or parts of them how she wanted. We are two years apart, her being 28, and me being 26. My uncle wastes a lot of money on hookah, and products on Amazon. He believes that my grandmother's house is his house (which is not true at all.) They, being my uncle and aunt are not allowing me to do things the way I want. I want to ensure that my money is going directly to the electric company in particularly because when I have contributed to the household as they (my aunt and uncle) have asked, I have watched my money be used in an unscrupulous manner and have had to deal with them (my aunt and uncle) basically monopolizing my time, so I can never progress with what I need to do in life, such as move out. My aunt tried to ask me how much money I bring in a month, and I refused to tell her. In my family, my family feels like if you are not forthcoming with information then something shady or bad has to be going on. In my case, that is not true. I am a young woman wanting to better herself and continue pursuing her passions (ones that actually will provide for myself and my OWN family --- children, ect if I have any) and leave a legacy behind when my time comes. I am thinking not of just today, but later on down the line. My uncle is very immature. While his mother (my grandmother) was in the hospital due to a heart attack and stroke, he brought a random woman over and had sex with her in his mother's bed, and the girl was very loud and disrespectful considering that I am right down the hall. (Keep in mind, he has his own room on the third floor of the house where no one would be able to hear or see anything he is doing). He also has a superiority complex. My grandmother is still sick, and is supposedly coming home soon. I am trying to save so I can move, and have been the one helping my grandmother while she is sick. I am aware that I am dealing with a toxic family member (well, family members.) My uncle will downtalk me, calling me a bum, saying I don't have certain things, because he doesn't see where any of my money is at or goes (He isn't supposed to, I am a grown adult) , but at the same time, putting every road block in my way to keep me in a position where I can't get on better footing. I honestly feel my family just wants someone that they can talk about and put down. I have told my family that I don't have access to cash, so I can continue to save and move. I did say I can contribute in other ways. I have been the pariah of my family due to what a lot of people have said about me, lies and things that are untrue. I have family members that just want me to fail. I know that for sure. I have thought about waiting for next month's bill to come, and taking the account number off of it to directly pay my portion of the electric bill. To anyone who feels I may be being selfish, complaining , or lazy, I am none of those things. I am currently working and saving money to move to another state. I was taught at an early age to trust my gut, and everything is all messed up right now. I have watched my family and am aware of how they operate. I don't want to be around people I can't trust. Family will betray you faster than your enemies. I am asking regarding this situation, what should I

"Just venting Not sure the general gist of where this post is going but I just kind of want to write down my thoughts. I tend to feel better after I do so. Maybe along with that I can have the added bonus of affecting somebody else in a positive way with what I say or that someone else understands what I'm saying. I'm alone as I type this. I'm sure many people who frequent this sub would describe themselves in that way. I feel over the years I've been getting more and more depressed. I was depressed when in my teens then I hit a lull in my 20s where I just didn't care about much and put things out of mind. Now, I seem to be at a combination of both. A kind of dead, feel nothing type of feeling mixed in with depression. I've been getting angrier as well. Bitter and resentful. I feel like when I was a teen I just thought strongly that I wasn't very great in the general sense. I feel like I now know that to be true. After enough life experience and enough time with yourself you start to see who and what you are. Needless to say I don't like who I am. Maybe you don't either. I'm not as strong, wise, caring, compassionate, friendly, hard-working, courageous, generous, et fuckin cetera that I'd like. ""Well, why don't you change?"" Cause I clearly don't fuckin want to. Maybe I enjoy being depressed? Because obviously I've laid out terms, so to speak, for me to be depressed. Not courageous, hard enough working, kind etc etc. Yet, I don't do shit about it. So why complain as if I'm depressed because of it? I think that's where the day to day numb feeling comes in. It's like ""I am this way. I don't like being this way. I don't change being this way. Why tf are you even upset?"" I really don't feel I deserve what I have in my life. Like the organ donor program I feel I'd want to give my body to someone else. Maybe they can make better use of my fully functional legs. My vision. Ever see those people do an absolute fuck ton of things with their life? Those people who are so driven to accomplish a b c d e f g... Every day of their life and they only have 1 limb? Are blind? Live in abject poverty? I have NONE of these fucking hurdles. I, in fact, don't have anything anyone would legitimately call a hurdle in life and yet I feel depressed. It's probably justified that I feel this way. I don't do anything to try and feel better and I don't capitalize on advantages I have in my life to make things better. To grow as a person. I don't do that for myself let alone for other people. And yet I want to have success.. I want to have profound love. Meaning and purpose. What a joke Just wish I could hit the fast forward button on this shit and get through with it. Oh right.. There's suicide. But even that holds it's own unique stigma to it. Next to no one would recommend you do that. It's not an ideal solution. So on and so forth. But you kind of have to admit that those that do go through with it... It's as if you can't question them. You can't question their pain. Can't question their sense of guilt or anguish or depression and sadness. They solidified it and made it real moreso than practically anyone could ever do when alive. Sometimes I wonder if those that commit suicide do so because it's either a) the only perceived way out of their grief or b) that it effectively proves to others beyond a shadow of a doubt what kind of hell they had been living through in the years leading up to doing it. You can never question someone who killed themselves as to whether their pain was real. Not just in the sense that they're no longer around to ask but that no one would ask what everyone inherently knows. Of course they felt pain. I feel that might be suicides greatest allure. It effectively puts a stamp on your sadness as legitimate. I've thought about it a lot throughout my life. I don't think I'd ever have the stones to do it. Maybe my life or state of mind just isn't that bad. Not yet anyways. Kind of a long read :/ Hi to all those that like reading long posts from internet randoms ð

"Pissed at my wife and mother in law We are new parents with an 8 month old baby. Here is how my wife's day looks like: Take care of baby, clean the dishes, do 1 laundry and cook dinner 3 times/week. Here is how my day looks like: I help around by taking care of the baby at least 2 hours/day so my wife can rest. Other times I work 10+ hours/day because I have a business to run or I clean up the mess my wife makes around the house. Make breakfast and lunch for all. I just found out at our last family gathering that my mother in law said to all my relatives out loud that I don't contribute to helping my wife. I literally lost it. Because she talked about me behind my back and I had no way to defend myself. I'm so pissed off I just want to call my monster in law and give her a pile of shit about how lazy her daughter actually is and that she only knows half the story and that she had no f'ing business talking dirt about me behind my back.

"Anyone elses depression feel like this? Good day, This might be weird but stick with me. I suffered/suffer from depression. Basically from middle school to about a year ago when I finally started on medication. The best way I could describe my depression is voices in my head saying mean and awful things to me, about me, about what other people are thinking or saying about me, turning positives into negatives etc. I started playing a game called Hellblade Senua's Sacrifice tonight and the their is a theme around psychosis, and the main character has many voices in her head. Here is the opening, (possible trigger warning?), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rob7C1lCYEI As soon as I heard all the voices calling Senua names, putting her down, laughing at her etc. I was like holy shit that was me. I am not trying to say I have/had psychosis, I just thought that the voices thing felt like what I went through. My voice, telling me terrible things, spinning stories, like someone else in my head, working against me. Anyone else feel like Senua/me?

"I am overwhelmed by guilt over my boyfriend's sexual assault of my once-best friend. My boyfriend of 2 years and I both suffer from mental health issues and trauma. I found out somewhat recently that months ago, when my then-best friend was sleeping over we were both asleep in the bed and he touched her sexually. Apparently he was stoned and thought he might start a threesome (it was casually mentioned as a possibility earlier). I know what he did was horrible. It makes me sick to my stomach to think that I was there and couldn't help. It makes me throw up and stay up at night knowing that I stayed with him. On the other hand, he himself is absolutely sick with guilt. He's been having non-stop anxiety attacks, crying spells, and moments of catatonia and he can't stop saying how horrible it was that he did that and how he wants to be a good person. I believe he is genuine and my first reaction is to make sure he gets treatment so nothing close to that ever happens again. He checked himself into a psychiatric ward last night. I'm also so overwhelmed by guilt by how selfish my internal response has been. He has cheated on me before multiple times, and I can't help but ruminate on how if I were prettier this wouldn't have happened and how it effects me. One recent (smaller) time just happened and I've had to take care of his emotions while being angry about this main terrible incident and that one. Furthermore, I'm selfishly worried about how badly this is affecting me. One of the few (maybe only?) things going right in my life is school and this is affecting me so negatively in my inability to concentrate or motivate myself. I'm also upset by how critical others have been of me in this even though they are at least partially justified. He posted his story to Reddit and got mostly cautious support. I posted mine and got a lot of messages calling me a pervert, an enabler, a shitposter, and a terrible person. He told his parents and one of the things they said was ""all three of you made mistakes"". Unrelated, but last night he posted a photo of us in the ER and a girl who hates me replied ""ew you're back with her? Nonono what are you doing."" I have no idea what I've done to make everyone in my life hate me this much. I don't have anyone left and I'm scared to lose the one person that has stuck around so far.

Itâs always like I try something and want to better myself, have high expectations and then life comes, uppercuts me, spits on me and just screams âYou thought, bitchâ. I had a really good therapist but she suddenly quit due to illness. I had to wait several months until I got the final answer. Had no therapy in that time between and also we only had like 6 sessions. Now I have a therapist who is ok but I just donât vibe with her that much. And I canât change because of insurance. Nor do I have the money to pay for one myself since Iâm a broke ass student. I told her once that I donât want solutions. I want someone to genuienly understand me. At first she tried and now itâs all solutions again. âTry this, try that, we need to experimentâ. I get the thought but I feel like my deep down feelings are just irrelevant once again. My first therapist really understood me and listened. I could cry my heart out and afterwards I felt so much lighter. I really miss that feeling. Now itâs just an obligation I have to do. Back then I never used to come late to my therapy sessions because I really looked forward to it. But now I am constantly running late because deep down, I just donât want to go anymore and give up. I donât have energy for that. I also took anti depressants (Tianeurax if anyone knows that one). At first it helped me, especially with processing feelings. But then I turned super suicidal and had mental breakdowns over mental breakdowns. I completly stopped and now I feel numb again. I want to feel suicidal and emotional again, to be honest. At least I processed something. Now I feel empty and dead inside once again, like how I used to be all the years before I started therapy and taking anti depressants. My ânewâ therapist asked me what I can bear more. My suicidal state or this passive suicidal state. I told her the last one. But honestly, I want it to be the first one. At least I felt like a human. At least some people cared because they were afraid Iâd do something to myself. Now no one cares. Iâm alone. I donât go outside anymore. Iâm just isolating myself again. No one really talks to me and Iâm just a bother to everyone. I honestly think about taking my anti depressants again, just to get suicidal and off myself. Despite often being a bad actor, I am just so well at playing this role of âOf course, I will try! I will do my bestâ. Iâm good at pretending nothing botherâs me and everythingâs fine. Iâm good at pretending to say âWow, your advice helped me so much, thank you for listening!â. But Iâm just a fraud. Nothing helps. Afterwards I just want to die more. Sometimes I ask myself, why the hell do I even put up with all of this. The only reason why I havenât killed myself yet is because itâd financially ruin my family. I donât even care about emotions, I doubt itâd be that bad. No one likes me anyway. Just so they donât get into debt with my death or sth. I often find myself also thinking that I will never leave a goodbye letter or tell them goodbye. Because no one cares anyway. I told them many times before why I want to die. I donât feel like anyone deserves that anyway because they donât put as much energy into me as I put into them. Whenever I feel like it goes up, it just crumbles down. I really donât know how much of this I can take. Iâve been like this since 6 years old. Iâm 21 now. I donât know why I got thrown into this world when Iâm ridden and infested with mental illnesses.

"Today I realized I don't have any friends. Not really. This weekend I was going to go to a Harry Potter symphony with my two aunts. One of them and my grandma, who all live together, got sick. They gave me the three tickets. They told me to go with friends, but they don't want to chance getting me sick or no one staying with their mom. Fair enough. As I was driving home from work today I was thinking about who to take, and I came up blank. No one came to mind. I have my roommates, but I don't really talk to them much and they all have girlfriends that they hang out with all the time anyway. Even the ones I went to high school with. I realized the other day when they mentioned it in passing that they had started a new DnD campaign with a new guy. I'm never invited to dinners or anything anymore. We never make a big ass meal together on Saturday anymore. Honestly, I don't think they'd even want to go anyway. There's no one else I'd ask. Everyone at work is either dating someone or I don't know them well enough. I'm taking online classes so no one there either. I don't do anything outside of school or work. I don't even have any friends to take to this fucking symphony. Not even one. I identify more with the characters in the books I read than with anyone I know. I don't know what to do. I feel so alone. I'm not even that close with my family, not really. Not well enough that I can even really talk about my opinions and especially not my emotions. The therapist I saw about a year ago kinda threw me off as SAD and said it'd get better. I just dunno what to do.

"Why my relationship is killing me Okay, disclaimer, former relationship... but it still has a huge effect on my life. This girl was my best friend and my first serious relationship. I met her when I first got depressed, and we went to the same church together. I told her then that I didn't feel ready for a relationship, but she essentially stalked me all those (5) years ago. Christmas 2016, after dealing with a crap load more grief and depression, I was essentially forced into a relationship with her. I had just got over my main stint of depression the previous September, and my life was getting better. We still hung out as friends, but she kept pushing for more. However, she is so messed up. I have to say that now. I do still love her, and that will probably never change, but she needs professional help, and my mistake was thinking I could help her. She was my best friend after all. So, after a string of breakups, moving too slow and moving too fast, as well as her cheating on my several times, she finally called it quits one week after my birthday (November just gone). I had no say, because she'd throw a tantrum, but I had to take the initiative. Why? Because she no longer wanted to have my baby. In August, she fell pregnant. This could have been the week prior the Anniversary of our first kiss, but the nurse dated it on that specific date. That was one of the nights she cheated on me, with her friend's boyfriend, but it was ""just a kiss"". She tried to miscarry by drinking heavily for the next few weeks before coming to me about it; she had broken up with me the day after she cheated. I asked her there and then if she wanted to keep it. She said yes. We went to speak to my mum. My mum asked her. She said yes. She wanted to announce the pregnancy, to start all the planning, and looking forward to the future. I got a well paying job to provide for our future, a job I travelled hundreds of miles for each week, and it was only for a few months. But whilst I was away, she decided she missed all the drinking, drugs, and sex she was missing out on. She wanted to live with her friends (who she actually hates living with at times), and countless other reasons. However, she kept stringing me along until the scan, where she sent me a photo of our child before telling me she wanted to abort it. Oh, and I had planned a weekend away for us to relax and see some friends. She had me believe this was the start of my happy ever after, before ripping it away from me. She didn't speak to me for two weeks. When I finally did manage to get in touch, it was to collect my stuff. I took a mutual friend with me, the act as a buffer, and they couldn't believe the stuff that she said to me. Then I get a load of hate off her because people are contacting her about her choices. Remember, she has been posting on FB all about the baby, making sure everyone knows. She hasn't spoken to me since. She has blocked me anyway she can, even on WhatsApp only recently... not that it matters, because she wants nothing to do with me. This was my best friend, and my stalker, who for years wanted to be with me, have a family with me, worried I wouldn't want her because of PCOS, and got jealous over people talking to me on Twitter, and kittens! She couldn't even handle me showing up with chocolates and flowers! All that I've done for her, supported her, sacrificed for her... and this is how she treats me. Now, I am pro-life, and pro-choice. I gave her that choice, and she wanted to go ahead. I didn't force her or convince her. She led me. She set me up, just to rip out my heart. Seriously, if you only knew the half of it. The card she wrote for me for my birthday alone would have anyone convinced. But now, she is living her life. She is out drinking, smoking, doing drugs and sleeping with anything she can get her claws into. She has restarted her YouTube ""career"", and quite frankly, they're boring videos. Maybe she'll do better. I hope not. But I think that's normal. So why this post? Because it is killing me. I don't know how, but I'm still kicking. Depression is creeping at my door, and I do have horrible days, bad days where I am so demotivated. Yet, I cannot stop thinking about her. She has me broken, in ruins... even my faith has been hit hard. I don't understand what changed. I don't understand she did what she did. Why did she play me for so long just to hurt me? Everyone tells me to forget about her, and no one would allow me to go back to her (even if it was a possibility). All I want to do is to forget about her, because as the title says... this relationship is killing me.

"Depressed people get sick, too; How stigma in the medical community made me sicker Iâve often found myself in a chicken and egg situation with my doctors when it comes to depression. When I say Iâm sick, they are too quick to assume the depression is the cause of my pain and not the other way around. After five minutes listening to me breathe, looking into my throat, and and touching the outside of my neck, they are stumped so it must be mental illness. It got the the point that when I was having severe abdominal pain, I didnât go to the hospital. I had to push for any kind of testing, which took forever. When I finally found a doctor who listened to me, she told me I should have gone to the ER. Then I was depressed about that; I had let the other doctors make me doubt my own sanity. Turns out, Iâve been pretty sick and needed surgery. Nearly all of the issues they blamed on depression were due to a chronic, painful illness with no cure. Itâs bittersweet, Iâve solved a big piece of the puzzle for sure. But Iâm still struggling a lot. I just found out that I may be infertile. After my doctor said having a baby could help my condition. So that was depressing too. (I donât think my depression caused my infertility. Checkmate, doctors!) I did start seeing a psychiatrist, and he is a kind man. He diagnosed me with depression and anxiety. He has never suggested that my depression is the cause of my physical problems, and he seems to be sympathetic to me as a chronic pain patient. Heâs given me depression medication, but I donât know how much itâs helping. Chronic illness is a thing that happens to people and itâs just *depressing*. Iâve always had depression, but this just makes it worse. He has never dismissed me for feeling that way or written off my pain as being in my head. Just wanted to share my experience with others who might understand. People with depression can experience health issues and get dismissed so easily. It took me years and years to get anywhere. Itâs a struggle to cope with both mental and physical illness. Hereâs to getting through today, friends.

"the message i wasnt able to send him. Dear ex, today I found out all the truth. I saw you with her. Why have you been lying to me? Why do you tell me you'd love me forever when you don't. Why did you lie to me that you aren't talking to your ex when I know you have been.. when I saw a message that you sent her that said ""When I'm with her I think about you"" that hurt me so much..I still forgave you. Why did you lie to me about her ""suddenly"" coming to see you when you already knew she was coming to see you? Why didn't you tell me you were going to see her when you told me you were out with your friends? Why do I still forgive you even when you keep fucking up? Why do I love you so much that I didn't mind if you don't love me as long as you were by my side? Why did you even tell me you would make it up to me and gain back my trust when you don't prove anything? Why do you keep telling me so much lies? When were you ever sincere to me? Was I a rebound? Are you happier with her now when you used to tell me she never made you happy? Did you get what you wanted now? Is that why you left me? Am I the only one dying here? While you enjoy yourself when we only broke up yesterday? Did I really meant nothing to you? When I thought you could love someone like me because I can't even love myself. I depended on you and you destroyed me. I gave up everything for you. My dreams, my friends, my family, my time, my efforts, blood, sweat and tears for you. Maybe it's just my fault for not being good enough. Maybe I wasn't pretty enough for you? Maybe I was right.. she was irreplaceable after all. I knew it.. no one can love me. I am not mean't to be loved. I am so capable of loving someone so much but that person is always not capable to give the same love. My heart has been torn apart again. When I trusted you so much with my fragile heart. When I prayed to god you weren't like my previous ex. You became like him.. except you were even worse. Why promise me things that you couldn't keep? Why tell me that you love me when you never did.. I just hope that all the memories we had together, at least just one tiny part of it was sincere. Where you actually loved me and was genuinely happy. I'm sorry again that I was good enough to beat her. I hope you and her will stay happy and be together forever. I just really am never mean't to be loved.

"I'm 19 and tired of living I'm writing because I don't have anyone else to talk to in real life that could understand me. I'm a 19 years old girl, close to turning 20, never had a relationship in my life and only kissed a boy once. I've had boys hit one me before but I always turned them down. I feel terrible that I've never dated anyone, but in reality I don't even know what my sexuality is and I don't think that I'd be a good partner to anyone. I feel so miserable and sad all the time. I hate my body and my appearance even though I know that I'm not really ugly. I don't know why my self esteem is so low. I don't have energy anymore do anything in my life. I don't have a lot of friends and the ones that I've had in high school I don't talk much to them. I always end up isolating myself from people and the regretting it later. I don't know why I do this. I don't why I hate myself so much. I just wished that I could love myself. I think I'm depressed but I don't know for sure. I went to a psychologist a while ago and all I could do was cry and tell them how miserable I felt and they basically didn't tell me anything and it felt like a waste of money. Anyway, I don't know what I have, I just know that there's something wrong with me. I feel like I've wasted my teenage years away being socially anxious and not connecting with people, and I don't why I am like this. I just wished that I could socialize and be happy and not care so much about how I look and how others perceive me. The year is coming is to an end and I am just feeling terrible because I'm still lonely and depressed and because I'm not in college yet because I didn't study enough for the entrance exam. Anyway, sorry if my English is bad, I've always lurked in this sub and I wanted to post something to know that I'm not alone.

"Female reasoning Why does it seem most women try to justify or get approval of a friendship with a male by stating knowing then for a lengthy time. Do women truly feel that no platonic boundaries will be broken because theyâve âknown each other for 15 years/since freshman yearâ etc. I donât believe it impossible for a platonic opposite sex friendship, but I do feel it is much harder for a male, for several reasons. Men typically seem to misinterpret a female being nice as expressing interest or flirting, that can easily plant the seed for a romantic attraction to develop. A mans ânatural desiresâ and wants, can easily blur the lines, and when in the right environment/setting they feel it is acceptable to attempt something etc etc. I donât see how whatever length of time negates the possibility of anything happening. Do women honestly feel because of a long friendship ensures its innocence? Or just an excuse/reason given in an attempt to âjustifyâ or have that friendship accepted by their significant other.

"Help with/what to do about toxic sister? (Sorry for sloppy wall and if this isn't the right thread) As the title says I don't know what to do about my 29 year old sister. She is known by the family to be immature, selfish, and impulsive. She repeatedly burns bridges with family when she does not get her way and will give them the short end of a deal if it benefits her (ie. Not paying my financially struggling mother back on the multiple occasions of covering her rent or car payment because she decided to use her paycheck on a new TV or $200 purse). I'd love to not speak to her and never go to her place but because she is the mother of my 2 year old niece this is not possible. To give you some perspective, she has fights with my niece's father who got their old apartment raided by the police for selling heroin (finding heroin and a pistol in a safe in the apartment) to the point of yelling and hitting, even late at night when the child should be asleep, right in front of my niece. Because her father is soon going on trial and to prison for a long time (ex convict in possession of a firearm on top of selling heroin) and as previously stated, my sister being a half-assed parent, I am left to clean up after her when it comes to my niece. I have to be consistent in teaching her not to hit people and not to spit at them. Again, to give you some perspective, I am 15 years old and do not need the stress of making sure a child grows up to be a decent person on my plate. My sister has multiple DUI and assault charges which have resulted in her drivers license being revoked yet she continues to drive with my niece in the car even when everyone who knows her and cares about the child tells her not to. Although she is better now she is still a complete ass of a parent with her first kid dying before the age of one and losing custody of her two other sons about 9 years ago (older one being 13 and the other being 9). I am actually convinced her uterus is hexed because every time she has a kid shit goes horribly south which makes me terrified in the case of my niece. In the winter of 2016 my sister attempted suicide (my niece being just under 1) and while her drug dealer boyfriend screamed at her while she laid on the floor saying she wanted to die I had to make sure the child was still sleeping through all of it in the next room. Now although few and far apart, I've had my struggles with depression so I understand how difficult postpartum depression can be but even then I believe as a parent you always put the child first in every scenario. On top of everything else she completely spoils my niece buying her an unnecessary amount of toys and candy whenever she reaches for it at the store and I know she is not going to be able to handle it when my niece wants something at the mall my sister absolutely cannot afford at the moment and her entire worldview changes when she realizes she does not get everything she wants when she wants it. Although I mostly enjoy being alone and I have never been in a relationship I can only imagine possible significant others would not be totally understanding when I try to explain that my niece comes first which only adds to the stress and worry. To be clear, my sister is not neglectful and provides for my niece with everything a child needs such as diapers, food, bed, cleaning, etc. but if she continues this way (which I know she will) my niece will grow up with the same characteristics as my sister and it's just about all up to me to make sure that doesn't happen. Can someone please, PLEASE help me?

"The divorce talk The wife and I have had a very empty and distant relationship over the last few years. After a couple of very difficult circumstances in our lives we sought counseling several times which didn't help at all so we resigned ourselves to being basically roommates for the sake of our children. Neither of us cheated BTW or at least I didn't. We decided to talk last evening and alot came out. We're ready to call it quits. I knew the relationship was dead but thought we would eventually come around. I love her and am committed to her. She ""loves me but is not in love with me"" anymore. I'm scared of what this will do to our kids the oldest is very sensitive. We decided to try a thing. We're going give ourselves X months and set aside time every evening to really talk about the things that bother us, the things that brought us to this situation, what we fear for it kids, what we want for our lives, all of it while doing it best to accept/not judge the other person. We have not really spoken to each other like this since before the kids so this may help. If this doesn't change the relationship we'll decide whether we'll separate or divorce. I have not told her this but I will be considering the option of suicide since I feel it would be easier for the children to cope with my death than to give them any reason to believe it was in any way their fault.

"Getting motivated to get help I was diagnosed with a mood disorder and PTSD ~1.5 years ago. I was getting help for a while but I dropped out of school and moved out of state so I just haven't been able to do that in the past year. I live with (and mooch off of) an SO but I've been fairly isolated for about 6 months. I've been doing online school but had to drop my classes this semester when I started working. Now all I do is this stupid part-time job. I should probably quit because it makes me incredibly suicidal. It's all so superficial. It doesn't feel beneath me but I really just don't mesh with it. Anyway. Health insurance. I can't figure out how to fill out the income stuff. A hospital near me has people that can help but I just can't find the motivation to even call them. It's like I'm trying to prevent myself from getting help. It's not even just psychiatric reasons that I want health insurance. I have a referral for a neurologist. I've been having memory issues, twitches, etc. I know I won't go without insurance. I probably could stand to get on birth control and check out some other persistent problems too but a) I know I won't be taken seriously and b) the only thing I genuinely like about myself is my mind so that's the priority. I'm not completely not trying. I'll take St. John's Wort if I'm persistently suicidal but it doesn't help with motivation. I've been going to support groups. I'll ""decide"" to be motivated but end up collapsed and sobbing before I get out of the door. Play music, leave my phone behind so I don't get sidetracked. Tell people what I'm doing so I feel pressured to keep my word. Incentivize with promises of fast food, caffeine, or chocolate. I dunno what else to do. I can't even tell if it's laziness or depression or something else. The only thing that motivates me to go to work is fear which is also the main thing that prevents me from quitting.

"How To Get Over The Pain I ended/lost a friendship with a best friend of 14 years. She was really good to me, once upon a time; I was declared disabled and lost my house and she let me move in with her and her husband to get back on my feet. For all she knew I could've been the Thing That Never Leaves. But I lived with her for about 9 months, got a job, and got my own place. She's Mormon, and during this time had her first kid. She insists everything's fine, no worries (because she had to, I think; Mormons put a lot of pressure on their women.) But things start getting distant between us, and this is only something I notice in hindsight. I got the greenlight to publish a book, and she offered to typeset because she had InDesign. Okay, are you sure? Yes. You're sure? Yes. Okay, cool, thanks, that's awesome, I don't have to do it myself cause I don't have the program or know how to use it. I give her a deadline for October and pay her. Well, I bust my ass on this book for months. It's the most important thing I've ever done with my life and it means everything to me. And 4 days before deadline, I find out she's only done up to Chapter 5 on the book. Which basically means she fucked off for 4 months, and did nothing, which means she's going to do a rush job. That automatically means more mistakes that I have to depend on her to fix, which she didn't in the first place, and she's totally shattered my trust. I freaked the fuck out on her and had a hysterical meltdown. It was bad, and I don't make any excuses for it. I was really shitty to her. I panicked and thought she was going to hold the book hostage with procrastination, and I had no way to get the files from her. I'd put myself up shit creek, because it was too late for me to learn InDesign. Well, she was defensive, to say the least. She said I don't need to police her time, and I should've known this is how she works. I felt like she was trying to gaslight me, so I posted on Facebook about the situation without naming names and asked other professional artist friends if this was appropriately professional behavior. They said no. That REALLY pissed her off, because a few days later I got a letter. In it she said she'd done all this stuff for me (let you live in my house, put up with your shit etc.), said I didn't want her to have her dream family and dream life (she was doing horse archery competitions and I didn't want her to do that, either, apaprently), my shitty upbringing made me dysfunctional, and she gave me an ultimatum that I had to make a change. Until then she said she didn't want me to talk to her, and she was ""closing her door to me."" I felt supremely judged, i.e. ""My perfect Mormon family was NEVER dysfunctional, so obviously you're the problem here, as a dysfunctional person yourself. Not me."" I felt like I'd been un-forgiven, ""Hey, remember all that stuff I said I forgave you for? Surprise!"" And I felt horrible, like I could never apologize enough, and that from here on out I was going to be scapegoated because I was the fucked up one and she was the squeaky-clean Mormon. I left her alone for about 6 week, not talking to her like she said. Then I reached out, apologized, and asked if we could talk in person without anymore nastygram letters. And this, to be honest, is where I'm most mad at myself, because I wish I'd just cut things off the minute she started talking like her shit didn't stink. Instead, we met, and she said my apology made her angry because it sounded like I'd disregarded her letter. I was a bit taken aback, because the letter sounded like one of those venting things where you're supposed to write them but not send them, and instead she was acting like she'd sent me gospel I needed to abide by. I said I felt like I was always going to be the wrong one, no matter what. She said I came from a dysfunctional family, compared me to a fear-agressive dog, and said ""Which problem is more in need of fixing?"" So in other words, yeah. Yeah, I was always going to be wrong, because no matter what she did I was always going to be worse because of my background. She said I'd declared her typesetting ""a failure"" before I even saw it, and insisted she'd done a good job. I told her there were obvious mistakes, like misaligned tabs and words running into illustrations, and she said she'd made the deadline and reiterated that once again, I should have known she procrastinates. I told for someone who had gone to church for twenty plus fucking years, she didn't know how forgiveness works because Jesus doesn't say ""Forgive thine enemies, until you've got a whole pile of ammunition and can really use that shit against them."" (I'm agnostic.) She said she'd already apologized (implication being that I couldn't forgive) and when I told her it felt like she could never make a mistake, she screamed ""YOU JUST WANT ME TO GROVEL!"" and stormed off. Her husband came out, yelled at me, and told me to ""handle my shit"" and called me a toddler. Previously he'd admitted to me in private that he wouldn't hire his own wife for a job because of her lack of professionalism. The next day I wrote her saying I needed my book files, to make sure the publisher could make corrections. And once that was good to go, I told her I was

"How can I get my finances back to a point where I can go to school or to a point where I donât hate my life? I guess some backstory. Iâm 19 about to be 20 in September. When I was in spring of 11th grade my mom got sick (Lupus or something, honestly she might be faking it but thatâs a whole different post.) Anyway she went to the hospital and was there for about a month. I ended up skipping a lot of school to be able to care for and do all the general house duties for my younger brothers. (11yrs old and 1yr old at the time.). Things progress my mom misses a lot of work we end up moving with my grandma. Now hereâs where shit really hits the fan. So tensions build between my grandma and my mom because of my moms suspected prescription opiate and Benzo abuse. Anyhow, dfchs gets involved (not related to the drugs but that didnât help) about 4 months before I go to college and my moms health deteriorates seemingly out of nowhere. So freshman and sophomore year Iâm juggling trying to work to support myself, school, and helping my grandma take care of my brothers. I thought I could handle it, I couldnât. Of course my schoolwork suffered and my gpa dropped below Hope eligibility. So I tried to find a full time job, and I did. Then got laid off not too soon after due to âbudget cuts.â My first time experiencing adulthood. Shortly after my car died and my depression got to a dark place. What followed is 3months of applying to anything I could reasonably walk to (I was trying to search within 5miles) because transportation in the part of Georgia I was in was a huge deal and I could not get around. No jobs responded. Including the Walmart a mile away with a fucking hiring sign out front that I repeatedly went in to try and talk and build rapport with the managers. During these 3 months I took out 3 credit cards and ended up maxing them out. I needed food and other essentials that I simply had no money for. The depression kinda spiraled out of control. I had a plan in place to hang myself but my friends at the time took the rope I was going to use and I was too broke to buy another. My dad who has been in and out of my life. Mostly out prior to this. Invited me out to come stay with him and his family in LA while I tried to get myself together. Iâm working hard, I found a job here. Retail but itâs a job. Iâm waking up early, Iâm doing noFap and Iâm working out 3x a week to try to keep my depression in check. But despite all that, I want to kill die still. I donât see a future where Iâm able to continue school. Dfchs told me they couldnât help pay for college because âI wasnât in for long enough before beginning collegeâ but they had no fucking problem coming to my dorm and asking me questions and causing stress once a week. I feel like Iâm barely supporting myself, and honestly I havenât talked to my brothers since the youngest ones birthday (April 15th). Because I feel like I failed them. I havenât talked to my grandma either because I feel like a disappointment. And my mom keeps calling me every other month telling me sheâs gonna kill herself because she feels like nobody loves her. Even through I bent over fucking backwards trying to help her by bringing my brothers to see her and making sure they could talk. (My grandma and the rest of my moms family wonât talk to her because sheâs cursed all of them out horribly when they tried to be there for her)

"Does anyone else's depression show itself as exhaustion? I find as I get older, that certain heavy type of exhaustion that can only be caused by depression gets more and more pervasive. As soon as things start going downhill, the unexplained tiredness hits and I become like a zombie. I have no energy to do my normal daily tasks, the thought of going through my evening routine before bed seems like climbing a fucking mountain; I barely have the energy to do anything other than sit on the couch and stare into space. The physical lethargy always comes hand-in-hand with the Brain Fog. Forget trying to study, forget going through the bills, my brain can't handle anything except moving my index finger to scroll down Reddit and watching cheap entertainment on youtube or Netflix.

"what is going on with my mom? As I've gotten older I identified something which was probably a source of a lot of neuroticism growing up, but I'm not really sure I'm in the right for noticing this. I have no idea what this is, I haven't met many other people that do this. But my Mom will do this thing where, the happier I get, the less comfortable she is around me. She tries almost frantically or rabidly to cut me off mid sentence or like ""steal my affectation."" Like mirroring that is a bit too eerily similar. Its almost like a ""being a person contest."" I always feel like, gross afterward. Like someone got in my head and took a part of me then did a parody of it. It seems like nothing is going in, and only like warped versions of what I just said are coming out. Like her identity is being threatened or something. And it's only when I'm happy. She seems completely comfortable when I am depressed, and its still all out, no in. It's like she's doing a one man play. I mean I could be overthinking this, I just don't know. Is anyone skilled with like psychoanalysis or something? It seems surreal. I've rarely seen people do this. Am I doing something wrong? Like, am I not being a person right or something? She seems so unnerved by signs of happiness. It almost makes me feel fake or something. It legit feels like I'm beating her at tennis or something. Like the more emotion I am feeling naturally, she tries to one up me. And hers does not feel natural. It makes me uneasy. Is there a reason a person would do this? I really am eager to know what this is or how I can avoid it or make ends with it.

"Aha! moment during therapy So I've been meeting with a therapist about once a week since October of 2017. It's been really great, and has helped pull me from the brink more than once. Background: I'm gay, and was raised Catholic in the 90s. Guess what happened next! Spoiler: I was bullied mercilessly. If I wasn't too gay, I was too fat, or too tall, or too weird or too unpopular. You get the gist. It it wasn't my hair, it was my mannerisms; if it wasn't my high voice, it was the dark circles under my eyes. (Gee, what could have caused me to be losing sleep?) Flash forward to today: My therapist guided me through a meditation today that instructed me to visualize and speak to a younger version of myself. I described what I looked like, what characteristics defined me, and how I saw myself. Then I was instructed to, as myself as the adult I've become, speak to that child and tell him what I was feeling. I spoke with kindness and compassion and love and respect for that child, and told him everything would be alright. I told him that all of that hatred was wrong, that it was incorrect and that those people who say all those nasty hurtful things, they probably aren't even going to remember saying it, so don't waste your time holding onto it. And it got me thinking about all of the baggage I've he'd onto my life. All the glances and side comments and nasty, hateful things. And how I've internalized it, and believed it. And that's when the Aha! moment came. *All this time, I've been so worried about all the bullying that other people did, I wasn't even thinking about all the bullying I did to myself.* https://media.giphy.com/media/12KiGLydHEdak8/giphy.gif All this time, *it was me.* Sure, it was other people who planted those seeds, but it was me who perpetuated it, who told myself that they were true. After all, if you say something enough, it might as well be as true as anything else. So there it is. There's one step. It might just be one step, but it's a step in the right direction. There's my holy shit moment of the day, and I just wanted to share with you all. There is hope. There is progress. There is love. And I hope you all are able to find it.

"Unsure how to talk to friend about something they're doing, or well, not doing. [Advice] First time poster in need of a bit of advice. Sorry this'll be long. So basically, I've been having a bit of an issue with a friend of mine, we've been friends for around 3 years at this point and everything was great! We'd talk every day and hang out around once a week/2 weeks depending on schedules and [my] kids schedules etc. Then about 8(ish) months ago, she got a new boyfriend, and of course I'm really happy for her, she deserves all the happiness! Thing is though, over the last 5 months, there's been a steep decline in conversation between myself, said friend and another friend. Friend #2 and I have been making ALL the effort to make plans with friend #1 and we're getting almost nothing back. We'll text her and we'll not hear anything for days, but she's on Facebook or snapchat posting pictures of her and her new boyfriend, and when she does text back, it's a totally one sided conversation. Like I'll ask her maybe ""how have you been"" and I;ll get a page of text about how she has been with BF and what they've been doing and at the end it'll be ""okay, I got to go, bye!"" If I don't specifically ask her about her baby (who I adore, she's like my niece) I don't hear about her, at all. It's all about BF. Recently, Friend #1 and I didn't see each other for just over 3 months! (did I mention she lives 20 minutes away from me?) No matter how many times I asked her over, offered to go to her house, offered to take her to coffee etc, either the invite went unacknowledged, or she wanted to spend the time with her BF. At that point, I was a bit annoyed but, I understood that people have lives and sometimes things just don't match up. However, the reason I'm looking for advice is because, after not seeing her for 3 months and talking to her only a handful of times, she hits me up and asks if I can watch her baby so she can go out with another friend. (who wasn't even going, she took her BF) I said yes, as I know how it is to want to go out and not to have a babysitter, so my husband and I watched baby over night for her. The ONLY thing I said to her was that I had plans the next day after 1 so I needed her to be back before then. (spoiler: she wasn't!) So I couldn't do my plans and asked friend #1 to stay and hangout since I hadn't seen her for so long. In the 1 hour(!) that she stayed, she called my sister (who I had plans with - we were meant to take my youngest out for his birthday, because friend hadn't come back yet, my sister took him out by herself) a freak! She said 3 times ""imagine not waiting for you!"" I said to her, we'll it's because you weren't back and she blamed traffic for being 2 hours late... On top of the main incident, there's been an incident where she brought a stranger to my house (after I told her I didn't like strangers in my house or around my children) and expected me to be okay with it! She dropped the bomb of bringing this stranger to my house 15 minutes before they arrived and told them I didn't want them there so they felt awkward! (I did try really hard to make them feel welcome, and thankfully the kids had plans so they weren't put in the situation) The advice I'm seeking is - A. How do I talk to friend #1 about this without coming off as bitchy or upsetting her. and B. Should I keep being friends with her? I don't like to give up on a friendship, but I feel like she only wanted me around when she wanted something from me. Any advice is welcome, even if it's me being weird or whatever. Thanks guys.

"Where did I go wrong? Let me apologize by the rather lengthy post: Iâm not sure where to start. Recently, Iâve been having trouble with my friends and Iâm not sure why. I had a childhood friend since Elementary school, we would hang out often and now sheâs a stranger. She would say she was busy, but the last day I texted her, my dad had kidney surgery because he had cancer in his kidney. They removed the whole kidney and the day he got home, I texted my childhood friend that he was home and he was doing okay. She couldnât even take one second to respond âIâm glad your dad is okay?â That was it for me, I had to remove her on Facebook after she had to replied after a week, two weeks, etc. and I believe I deleted all messages on my cell phone, and Iâm not sure what happened ! Then this âfriendâ of mine, never messages me on either Instagram or Facebook. I think it began when I told her I asked out one of her friends a year ago (we are still friends, the girl I asked out), and from then she started not to respond to me. So, recently I told my friend who I asked out, about the communication between me and her friend. She told me that her friend, (who is also her roommate) that theyâre both extremely busy, which I understand, but and that âsheâ loves me, and doesnât hate me (my friend who doesnât respond, and not love in a boyfriend way.) But, if this is the case why doesnât she communicate with me online? Even when I see her, she waved hi to me and we talk a bit, but itâs not the same. There were times in the past where she use to hug me a lot, any time she saw me. But something has changed with her and me, I can tell. I think my friend (the girl I asked out), is unaware of my âfriendâsâ (her roommates) , true feelings toward me, and I mean that in a bad way. Iâm just not sure where I went wrong....

Usually i have something in my head, that keeps thoughts inside, but now its nothing here except my inner voice. If i imagine this, it looks like a big endless gray room with voiceless me and my clone somewhere in that room. Sometimes i think i can cry, but i can't even squeeze out a tear. I can show emotions, but feel nothing inside. I can smile if someone makes joke, but it's made up smile. I don't think friends know more than i told them, but i know there is something they hide from me. I go to school, but it ""feels"" like everything just passes around me, like i don't exist. I don't want anything, just go to sleep and never wake up, but it won't happen to me... I can't control anything. When i eat, food doesnt have any difference, it just fills void called hunger. I can't remember anything happened to me last 4 days. Is it bad memory or nothing really happened to me? Days ago i had thoughts, good thoughts, bad thoughts, suicidal thoughts, but they are gone now. Same with feelings. All i have now is emptiness. It hurts so much.

"I didn't expect there are people here so quick to judge and assume I made a post about how hard it is to date and find someone if you have depression. I mentioned how people with depression who have a significant other most likely have an easier time that those who don't. What I didn't imply was that I wanted that just for the sake of ""curing"" my depression. And that's what another member tried to pin on me. He or she quickly went into offensive and started preaching about how selfish it is to want to be in a relationship if you're depressed, how I should go seek therapy and that I should realize that relationships aren't a magic cure. I don't want to be in a relationship for it to fix my depression, I'm going to therapy, taking antidepressants for 6 years now and I am fully aware being with someone isn't a cure ( I was with someone while depressed for 2 years ). I wanted to reply to this person to explain they misunderstood me, but I was too upset, so I deleted the post. Perhaps my wording was not good enough, but still, such a judgemental approach to answering someone's post on a depression subreddit is in my opinion very saddening.

"It's hard to keep standing up, keep fighting, and get down each time. I just want it to end Iâm done. Hard work doesnât pay off. Ever since I was 14 I felt depressed and like Iâm not good enough. I felt like it was my own fault that I felt so sad and angry and that I wasnât good enough for other people. One day I decided that if it weâre my own fault I felt that way then I could also improve my situation. Al my negative emotions went into working hard. I finished my studies (not by working hard, but because I was good at it) and put all negative emotions into working out. I got accepted into a difficult job at the Army. Now I quit the Army because of an injury in my knees. At the same time I lost a girl, even though we only went on one date, I thought she could be the one positive thing to take from the Army and all the hard work I put in to get into the Army. So whatâs my situation now? Jobless, girls still despise me, have a degree with which I canât find a job with and all the work I put into improving my situation was for nothing. While trying to improvie myself and during my studies and time at the Army I still had periods where I felt very down. It just becomes harder and harder and harder to crawl out of it every time. The negative voices and feelings are too much and getting up to fight just becomes impossible. I had the power once to get up and try to fight. Now I donât even have the power to suicide. But I just wish it was all over. Eventhough it feels useless I might go to a psychologist. How has it helped you guys? I wanât to end it all but I donât want to end it all. I donât know. I feel lost and sinking deeper every damn time.

"Love is what makes the ride worthwhile Without love, why suffer through anything at all? For what gain? I've had love, and I lost love. Love is so powerful a feeling, its a state of being. A person always has within him to very different personalities. That's you without love and you while in love. In love, I'm full of goals, ideas, glass half full, my bank account may be low, but it doesn't effect me. I can deal with anything while in love. I'm more confident while in love. I loved to buy her little gifts, make desserts for her, clean the room so she can relax after a long day, shower with her and wash her body, and of course fuck. Out of love... I'm still in love with her, but we can no longer be together. I'm scared of the world now. Constantly battling anxious thoughts and worries. I spend my days now trying to stay above water, to not drown in the depression. But no matter how well I swim that day, the pull is still my depressive state.

Basically, I don't want to settle for what my life is right now. I don't want to accept a cheap, easy job. I don't want to accept my poor mental health, and I don't want to take any of the medicine I'm given. I don't want to live with my parents. I think my mom's not smart, and my step-dad has always been an angry alcoholic. I remember the feeling that he hated me ever since my childhood, but then I think he has trouble understanding people. I don't want to be any of the things I hate, and I became very hateful ever since that feeling and the mind fog started. I don't know. I felt like I'd type more, but it all revolves around money and things I hate about myself and other people. I just hate the life I have. I feel like I'm in a terrible mindset. It's a mindset that doesn't let me grow, but makes me think I should try as hard as I can to. I also feel insufferably tired lately, hence the sleep issues post on /r/getting_over_it.

"Crashing In Sorry this is long. I've been depressed since I was 15. First signs were at age 4. I found pot and stayed high for 8 years. Clean and sober for 30 years, I never stopped having suicidal thoughts despite medication. So I tried to bury the pain in relationships, which didn't work either. I've been married three times in recovery. I had a daughter who I love very much, and we used to be very close. She became a reason to live. Then 4 years ago she didn't want to live with me 1/2 time any more. She became argumentative and we fought a lot. Last year I found out she was accusing me of sexual abuse, with help from her mom ( first wife) and therapist, which is not true. The therapist never reported the abuse, and told daughter I have NPD, which also is not true. So I got a guardian ad litem to investigate and found my daughter was suicidal, claiming PTSD because of the alleged molestation. The lawyer never helped my daughter, sparking a slide into deeper depression. My wife and parents didn't do much to try to help. They got angry when I begged them to step in. Suidical ideation and inappropriate attention-getting threats became an actual plan, and a way to do it without leaving the stain of suicide. Then at work I made a $5 billion discovery that is extremely disruptive in the industry I work in. My quarter million dollar program found out millions are being spent on the wrong strategy. And 1/2 my team works on the other strategy at the same time as they are helping me, so they are taking steps to undermine the findings. Lately they gave up trying to block the discovery, and the fact that we can literally feed more people with no more land used for farming, by raising more animals (naturally) with the same amount of feed. I'm getting invited to speak globally about the discovery. The suicidal thoughts deepen, knowing the disruption to status quo is only beginning. Just before Christmas my third wife moved out, and I spent Christmas alone because my parents were sick. Last night she told my mom she intends to get a divorce. The medicine isn't working. The AA old timers are saying I'm depressed because I'm not working the steps correctly. I'm going to 2-3 meetings a day, most days. In two days I'm shutting down the case I opened to try to get help for my daughter. I can hardly work, because I can't complete thoughts very well any more, being so depressed. I've been complaining about feeling depressed and suicidal, because it's true, and it became a way to relate to the world, which makes people leave. The spiral is getting tighter, and it feels like a black hole is pulling me in. I can't imagine facing another divorce feeling this low. Mom said to get a roast beef out of the freezer and cook it with some potatoes and carrots and stop thinking about negative things. I went to Landmark and they say this is all just a story, and part of a racket I created to avoid responsibility. They say I can create something different by changing my story. I've tried a rainbow of medicine, and tomorrow I increase Latuda from 20 mg to 40, and keep the trintellex at 20, per MD. I can't do anything now because third wife will get 1/2, and parents are too old to deal with my belongings. My thoughts turn to seeing if I can find someone else who will love me anyway, or giving up. I want to give up but not really. I really want to live, but I can't see any hope. And I can't stand the thought of being alone. Any help, hope or ideas would be appreciated. Thank you.

"If people treated broken arms like they treated depression... Person: ""He dude, your arm is broken in half. You should probably call for help"". Me: ""I've tried calling for help, it doesn't work"". Person: ""Really? Who did you call?"" Me: ""I wrote a post on reddit and saw my school consellor once"". Person: ""Dude WHAT??? That's not how you fix a broken arm. Call the hospital, they are professionals and they use professional treatment that fixes this shit!"" Me: ""It doesn't work the same for everyone you IDIOT!"" Person: ""Yes it does! They deal with thousands of types of breaks, hairline fractures, ligament damage and all sorts EVERY single day! Theres an an entire field of medicine dedicated to treating broken arms and it's all PROVEN, time and time again, to work! You need to see someone who knows how to fix your arm! Or at least, stop the bleeding right now! Me: ""You don't understand what it's like to have a broken arm. You've never had one before."" Person: ""Yes, actually, I have had a broken arm before. I went to the hospital and they fixed it after surgery and months of rehab"". Me: ""Well obviously your broken arm wasn't a REAL broken arm. Mine is worse. You don't know what it's like to have a REAL broken arm"". Person: ""I had three compound fractures and internal bleeding. They said it was the worst they've ever seen. But they fixed it, and the rehab I've been doing has brought it back to 100% functionality"". Me: ""You're wrong. This is UNFIXABLE."" Person: ""Sigh. Straight up denial? Really? Well what do you plan to do about it?"" Me: ""I'm going to sleep all day and keep coming to reddit and message other people with un-treated broken arms!"" Person: ""You realise each day you do that, your arm will get worse"". Me: ""Fuck you. I'll have this broken arm FOREVER!"" - This is an insight into my mind from many years ago when I was dealing with depression. I can confidently say that it is fixable guys. Please don't listen to people who say it is completely unfixable. You can beat it, I promise! I love you guys. Good luck. &lt;3

"I thought things were getting better... Sorry for the little rant... I just needed to say this somewhere. After recently getting out of the hospital for a(nother) attempt at my life, I was surrounded by family and friends who want to support me. For a couple days this almost gave me a high, thinking that maybe I really am glad I wasn't able to go through with it or that maybe I was beating these years of depressiveness. Not even just after a week of getting out of the mental ward, I fantasize about what I could have done differently to have made sure I died that night. Going forward I thought I would be happy being able to see my younger siblings and my dog again, yet the only thing I can think of is them knowing I tried killing myself, and that I have added just another thing to deal with and another burden on them. I will now be treated with *care* and people will be on guard around me, and I didn't want to do that to them. This semester has started again and I have already missed the first week, and while part of me just wants to drop everything, I can't afford to start paying back the loans. I just want to curl into a ball and not exist and have to deal with it all. TL:DR - trying to take the easy way out has just made everything harder.

"Long distance girlfriend's family abusive to her I'm in a long distance relationship, and my girlfriend's family totally neglects her. She has a mom, dad, and older sister. The older sister is constantly cherished, and in her parent's eyes, does nothing wrong. My gf has to buy anything she wants, while her older sister gets everything handed to her. My gf gets almost straight A's, her older sister flunks classes. My gf's parents help pay for her sister's tuition, but kinda just shrug in her direction. Basically, her sister gets everything, and she gets the rags. Just today her sister went and broke her iPad screen for no reason, and her mom said she didn't believe her when she told her what happened. The older sister never gets grounded, but the gf gets grounded almost everyday, sometimes because her family ""doesn't wanna see her face."" So fucked up, right? Does anybody think there's a way for her to cope with her family's behavior? She's (hopefully) moving away to attend school in a year.

"My friend refuses to pay his 600 dollar lost wager to me. What to do? [Long text] One day, a friend and I started arguing about something. It turned into a heated but friendly discussion, and eventually we were both fed up with each other's differing views, so we both proposed a wager. We then spent the rest of the day simply arguing, but without any real conclusion, we decided to actually follow through with our wager. Before making the wager, we agreed on 600 dollars, and it was 100% agreed on from both sides. Fast forward to him losing the wager and promising to pay me within a month or so when he would get his next salary. I also felt a bit bad about winning, so I decided to call him and ask him what he would have done in the exact same situation if the roles were reversed. He said he would have taken the money. Right then and there, I decided I would also then take the money, as my friend is (or so I thought) a man of honor. During no time did I ever say I didn't want the money from him. Some time after I won, I made a little joke on facebook along the lines of: ""When am I getting my juicy money?"" with a little meme, as it would be awkward to simply tell him to pay me. He simply said: ""I invested the money into [[fucking]] ethereum [[of all things he could have done]], and it rose 16%! I probably won't pay you the money."" I thought this was a joke, but later found out he was 100% serious. Of course this made me mad - not only that he wouldn't pay me all of a sudden, but also that he broke the news in such an arrogant way. I then argued with him, saying he owed me the money and we agreed on it as two men who made a very serious wager, both knowing what we would get ourselves into. I know for a fact that I would have paid him the second I would have lost, and I have told him so many times. He now claims that it is too much to pay, that it doesn't feel right (yet he also feels guilt) and that I am being negative and should just move on. I get very mad at unjustice just like this, as could very well have lost the wager. I basically took a very unnecessary risk with this wager. I've told him I can't trust him anymore, but he seems to just want to move on, typing messages on Facebook like nothing has changed. He said he was sorry, but I don't accept the apology as he can still do what is right: pay me the money. He tried twisting this on me trying to make me look greedy, when in fact he is the one who fucking scammed his friend. What is your view on this?

"Being told by my brother making friends isnât that hard for someone my age bothers me every time I think about it Itâs pretty damn hard when I have no hobbies to relate to anyone except stay in my room on my computer because Iâd rather just be away from everyone so I donât make it hard on them. And being told to go to clubs by my parents. I just feel more of a disappointment when I tell them thereâs nothing Iâm interested in and that I also am too afraid to still be alone when I join one. Iâve done everything I could in my life to try to fit in or make new friends, and thereâs a reason why I have no motivation to try any of these anymore. And then they say it wouldnât hurt trying. That couldnât be any further from the truth. If I try to fit in again and still donât have anyone to talk to, Iâm gonna hate my life even more. Itâs like Iâm trapped. I canât do anything to please me. One day I want friends, then the next I donât want anybody at my school to bother me because I know they donât really want me to be there friend. Why does depression always put you in a trap that you canât get out of? Thereâs no solution except accept your problem and just be an introvert and ignore everyone.

"Friend problems So my school is a small school so in my class thereâs only 10-12 people. I currently have a friends letâs call them Monica and natalie. I hang out with them but, Iâm always the second one. By second one, I mean like a second choice. When one of them isnât at school or arenât with them, theyâll come to me. Itâs a problem when I have to get a pair for class activities like in PE. I had a friend who I thought she could be my real friend. Iâll call her hailey. I one told her a secret and she spoiled it to the whole school. I still gave her a chance. She started being really harsh on me and what I like which is photography. She would always insult me and say negative things that makes me think negative. I realized that we didnât really go well and that our interests are very different. So We kinda stopped hanging out often. I tried my best to be funny and social. My friendship between my friends (Natalie and Monica) were getting better but I was still the one that they didnât really care. Now hailey is trying so hard to be friends with Monica, Natalie and maybe me. Natalie knows that sheâs trying to âbe like usâ but Monica doesnât. Monica is slowly hanging out with hailey. Hailey started to ask me what I like to wear and all the small stuff. And she also wouldnât stop talking about my crush and his best friend. Which is uncomfortable for me. her personality changed and I realized she is actually trying to be like my friends. I currently donât know who should I be friend with since I donât have a best friend. Itâs quite embarrassing when I have to get a pair because I have no one. I donât know what to do.

"I am too much of a coward to even kill myself I am posting this here, not primarily to garner attention or sympathy, but because I have nowhere else to turn and I don't know what to do with myself. I also want to try and combat some of the embarrassment and shame that I feel in regards to being clinically address, so perhaps voicing what I am thinking here, it could potentially be therapeutic for me. Now that is out of the way,this might get quite long, so I will put a tldr at the end of this. Context: I am a 20 year old girl. My whole life, my sense of worth was dictated around whether I could make the people around me happy. I had extremely strict and controlling parents and so I had no real sense of worth other than the fact that at least I didn't harbour any malicious feelings towards anyone, or try and hurt anybody deliberately. I had normal teenage 'angst' and moody, brooding periods, but absolutely not depression at all. I was completely, for want of a better word, normal. In April 2017, I first had feelings of depression, when I realised how badly I had hurt someone who used to be very important in my life. (it is an extremely long story and I am slightly more at peace with it now so I don't feel the need to explain because it would take forever). I was incapicitated for a week, I would cry constantly, not leave my bed, and my mum would scream at me and tell me she 'didn't have time to deal with my shit'. However I had a REASON for feeling this down, so whether this was the start of a biological depression, I am not quite sure. Fast forward to October 2017. This is where my current situation and problems begin. I am currently studying abroad in Japan- something I have been envisioning and looking forward to for 10 years. Honestly, I had been constantly dreaming about this for an extremely long time. It was what I felt my life was gearing towards, everything led to this. However, it all went downhill. My host family is incredibly lovely, I had made a couple friends on social media before even joining the university, and there were so many intercultural exchange opportunities to join. Yet, despite this, I could feel my mood slipping gradually. I have always been a shy person and not good with strangers, but I began to feel a creeping anxiety looming up on me, that told me to not bother others, that by interacting with others I was causing them inconvenience and discomfort, and the best thing for me to do was to just be alone. I partly attribute it to the fact I had a really awful teacher in my first semester here. Now, I think some people might think that this might be a cultural shock issue, but I am pretty sure that she was crossing ANY acceptable line, no matter what culture. Firstly she would be very rude to me in front of all my classmates. Say if I came in without makeup, in jeans (like, still showered, hair done, not sweatpants or anything, just not completely dolled up) she would say in front of everyone 'Your face isn't pretty enough to not wear any makeup. You are scaring everyone. You know girls in Japan care about their appearance. You should do too, for everyone's sake'. (Also my Japanese is perfectly adequate to understand interactions like that, so I know for a fact that this wasn't a language barrier issue. ) If I got a question wrong in class she would say 'You know, I don't know why I bother asking planyourspontaneity for answers, she is so useless'. Or if we had to make example sentences she would pick examples like 'What does planyourspontaneity need? Oh planyourspontaneity needs to learn how to make some friends'. And this became like a running joke in my class. I have never been bullied, so I never learnt to grow a thick skin, so this (what felt like) daily victimisation began to really grate and tear down my self esteem. I felt isolated so my social anxiety caused me to isolate myself, and people ignoring me, creating a vicious circle. I began to be completely mute in class, ignoring the teacher, be on my phone, having headphones in, and this obviously spurred her on as she would berate me for how I was a terrible student. Also I feel like it might be relevant to say how I told this teacher that the reason why I was so withdrawn and using my phone a lot was because my stepfather was undergoing cancer treatment and I was worried (this was true). But she still kept calling me useless and 'the worst student I have ever taught' to everyone. If I seemed withdrawn though she would stroke my thighs and lower back and neck (I think this contact thing might be a cultural difference but still) in front of everyone, which obviously made them think I was a total freak. If I made eye contact with them, they would quickly shuffle away or look disgusted. Around November-ish time I began to suffer with very extreme bouts of depression. I felt awfully ashamed- here I was living the dream I had longed for for about a decade, and I was here for some reason feeling absolutely dreadful. Even if I had had a fun day, I still had this lingering sadness, and I would get home and cry. I started seeing a counsellor which was one of the best decisions (or rather, my long distance boyfriend decided for me) I ever made. In December time it reached the point where I would barely go to class because the idea of seeing people, going to class, and even just getting out of my bed

"No lodging for the sad Being depressed sucks. That's easy to grasp. Most people who aren't clinically depressed understand this. What they don't understand is that being depressed and honestly trying to get better is extremely difficult, and our ruggedly individualistic society doesn't give a single fuck about you. You need help? Fuck you. Your wealth isn't just something you have, it's seen as a reflection of your worth as a person. Poor? Sad? Find it difficult to wake up? Find it difficult to complete things? Do you procrastinate because of underlying psychological issues? Fuck you, you're just lazy. The clear message capitalism sends me is that if I can't work, or I can't work enough, or I can't work doing a ""high value job"", or if I need help to get better so that I can do those ""high value jobs"", I probably ought to just go die, because I'm clearly worth nothing.

"My best friendâs husband shot himself friday night. Iâm angry. He was a manly man. All of us.

"Am I depressed? Or is this just my personality? The littlest things get to me. A small criticism here, a misread facial cue there.

"For the first time in my life i liked this girl and when she left life around me doesn't make sense. Why does this pain happen to people This is my first time and please i need some answers on what to do, why does life work this way, i fucking hate that things had to go wrong this fucking way. My depression is taking over me and my family is worried about me. For the first time in high school i liked this girl for about 7 months and during that time we became best friends and i always thought she would like me if i cared for her and treated her right. i always acted the same way as her and found out we thought the same sometimes. We always talked to each other including late night till 2 or 3 am and we knew everything about each other and we always were with each other but instead she liked some asshole who didn't like me and always kept lying about me to her. She never believed what he said about me but chose to love him and be with him more and they always were with each other after class and it made me jealous and angry on why she would do this. One day i invited her to some place with her and my friends but she decided to also want to take the asshole and i got frustrated and ended our friendship. she got angry at me and decided to leave too. but one day the asshole decided to leave her because of a fight they had and she starts crying to me on the phone and i try to help her get over him but it hurts me when she says she loves this person who kept lying to her about me and other things and he was known to be a bad person and she only dated one guy before but he was super nice and i didn't understand why she liked him and she said she didn't either, it was only that she felt happy around him. She is such a pretty girl and most of the guys in the school agree and thought me and her were dating but they never knew she really liked this asshole and during the time they hanged out she kept asking me if they were right for each other and she said she would separate from him but she didn't listen to me. Instead they got closer and me and this asshole got into more fights with each other but she would rather not say anything and still be with him. Now she is actually separating from him after all this time. Why did she do this to me after everything we've been through because i treated her way better but she did this to me and i dont know should i go back to her after what she did. Its been 2 weeks and i haven't talked to her since then and my mind has been thinking of ways to beat myself up because of this problem. Everyone knows im depressed but at this point i couldn't care and im losing my mind and i just need some answers of why she liked this asshole but not me.

"I want to die [trigger warning] [Trigger Warning] My trauma happened when i was 8, I'm now 18 and still suffer from it daily. I actually suppressed the trauma completely until I was 12, when it all came back to me; so I guess I've only really been dealing with it for 6 years now. I have severe PTSD, severe depression, anxiety, severe panic/anxiety attacks, OCD, severe memory loss, and had an intense eating disorder for 6 years that I'm still struggling with constantly. I haven't gotten a good nights' sleep in years. I have constant PTSD nightmares, regular nightmares, and insomnia/constant fatigue and exhaustion. I also disassociate a lot and self harmed for years. Currently clean from self harm for about a year and a half. I've been admitted to a hospital because of all of my mental problems, and honestly wish I could go back sometimes. I was gaslighted for years to believe that my trauma was normal. My home environment was constantly hostile. I go through long periods of feeling suicidal. Currently in that period. Don't know what to do, honestly. Years of being in therapy and being prescribed pills and yet I still am nowhere near being close to healthy. Looking back, I can't even remember the last time I was genuinely happy. The periods of my sadness last longer than my periods of calm. I'm so afraid of waking up when I'm 40 and still feeling the same way I do now. The thing about being an adult that spent their entire teenage years thinking they would have killed themselves by now is realizing that your mental illnesses have real repercussions. I have fucked bones and a fucked stomach because of an eating disorder that lasted so long and a GED because I couldnt find the will to do schoolwork when I was just trying to find the will to live another day and not cut myself again. I canât afford college because I didnât do any extracurriculars to get scholarships because the thought of having to stay after school made me want to have a panic attack and i just wanted to sleep. I have no friends because when people invited me to hang out my anxiety made me cry myself to sleep instead. I didnât have any real thought-out âgrand plansâ because I was too busy hurting myself and getting high and wanting to kill myself to really sit down and plan things out. I said I wanted to do things but never took the time to think it all through. It doesnt seem fair that I went through this trauma, had/have all of this mental illness, and now have to do with the repercussions of those illnesses. It doesnt seem fair that I'm suffering so much still. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm tired of trying so fucking hard. I know this is self-pitying and 'emo' but I just don't know what to do. I have no one to talk to. I really just want to die.

"Am I Depressed? While I've been distraught and suicidal on and off since age fifteen, I've never been formally diagnosed with anything because I don't trust the mental-health establishment. I've only visited a shrink twice: once when forced by parents, a second time when pressured by a partner. Because of this, I'm reluctant to claim I'm depressed except in the loose, colloquial sense. Instead, I feel my rage and despair flow quite appropriately from my failure to fulfill my desires, achieve my dreams, and so on. I hate being alive and would adore a sudden death, sure, but that doesn't necessarily mean I'm depressed, right? I don't experience many of the symptoms of formal depression: I sleep pretty well most of the time, I eat okay, and I'm socially active. (I feel abjectly isolated, but empirically I spend a fair amount of time with friendly acquaintances at events and so on.) I resist the medical model of my mental state because it assumes the problem's with me rather than with the world. I figure I'd be okay if I had the basic level of social success normal folks have: a number of close friends and a healthy romantic/sexual relationship with one or more partners. I'm becoming increasingly confident my genetics and values combine to make forming meaningful connections with other humans effectively impossible. Because I yearn for such connections intensely, it's only rational that this dynamic would make my life unlivable. I'm not depressed. My brain ain't malfunctioning; it's as valid a pattern as any. The uncaring universe approves of my mind as much as anyone's. I'm just not biologically equipped to thrive in the environments I find myself in.

"Me [28F] and my husband [29M] don't want children. His parents disagree with our decision so much that they want him to divorce me. For the past year, I've been weathering constant and continuous passive-aggressive attacks from my husband's parents. This issue has largely stemmed from our refusal to have children. They have also been contacting my parents, stating that they have issues with things we've said/done (mainly baby-related) and when we've tried bringing up the issue they lie and say they don't know what we're talking about and act like we're overreacting/being crazy/too sensitive. Recently, after his parents did and said multiple things in a short period of time, my husband tried to confront them again (not for the first time). During the conversation, his parents said some truly horrible (and in my opinion, unforgivable) things about me: They said that my refusal to have children (which my husband totally supports, and agrees with as he also doesn't want children) made me an abusive, mentally ill, toxic person and told my husband to divorce me. They also gave him an ultimatum: them or me. The conversation was not received well by my husband, and he, of course, chose me. He's very angry with his parents as they've refused to listen to and respect his wishes. However, they then decided to contact my parents to inform them of the mentally ill, toxic, abusive daughter that they'd raised because I wouldn't give them grandchildren. My parents, of course, were bewildered and tried to explain that we were happy, and that if we didn't want children, that decision should be respected. My husband's parents have not taken kindly to any of those suggestions. My husband and I have been together for five years, and are coming up to being married for three. I have made it clear to everyone involved that I don't want children, and I never have. My husband agreed and has always supported and agreed with this decision. At the moment, no one is really speaking to anyone, and I'm taking it rather hard. It's devastating to realise that his parents only ever liked or valued me as a 'person' when I was a uterus that was potentially giving them grandchildren. To hear from my parents that they're furious that I've disrupted the plans that they had for their son upsets me on so many levels that I can't even explain properly. I am no longer sleeping or eating properly. If it were me, and they weren't my husband's parents, I would cut them completely out of my life and never speak or associate with them again. While my husband feels like this is a great solution, I also feel that they are still his parents, and no matter how angry he currently is, he's going to want a relationship in the future. My question is - how do I do? How can I try and move forward with people who literally won't accept me unless I bear them grandchildren? How can I ever let go of the fact that they've made it abundantly clear to me, my husband, and my parents, that they view me as a uterus, not a person? I want to do the right thing by my husband and be supportive, but I'm completely lost in this situation, and I have honestly no idea how to move forward. --- **tl;dr**: My in-laws won't speak to me because I don't want children. They've threatened my husband with an ultimatum (them or me) and have insisted he leaves me immediately. What do I do? What advice is there for trying to move forward - especially with people who won't address me unless I give them grandchildren?

"Work I like to stay at work for long hours because it seems to be the only place where someone is glad to see me. I get to help my team members and we all laugh with each other. I almost hate to go home to someone reminding me of what I haven't done yet. At the same time, my coworkers don't really see me as a friend. I'm constantly on the outside of the conversations taking place. I'm often left behind during break and if a coworker shows or shares something with the other while I'm there,I will be ignored. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm cool enough to laugh and joke with but not cool enough for anything else.

I donât make enough money to really have any experiences, Iâm so bored. I canât take time off work even though I have PTO because the amount of work I have to catch up on even missing one day is unreal and it stresses me out more to miss work than it does to be there.

"19 M here...family dispute between uncle's n dad. PLEASE ADVICE hi..i am 19 yrs old and currently in college. please bear my poor English. so i know the title is kinda vague and idk i felt i wld get some views n advices here. so it all strtd from childhood. My uncle was jealous of dad in evrythng. Dad was adored by all d siblings he wasnt, coz he was grandmas eye n youngest. Actually grandma spoild him...kinda the pampered kid who is arrogant. He had his ways in evrythng. Ok den marriage, n kids. not bragging but i must say this...my siblings kinda ""got our shit together"" den his kids..in terms of academic performance or like social life in general...so maybe yeah that added Again highr level of jealousy. He evn said i got 1st rank in my high school (which i did..nerdy days)coz its a ""rotten school"". i am in another city too now, not homwtown. Den my uncle sent his kids to outside cities too , but all faild wid single digits. Shame added to jealousy probably . after some time he bought Hyundai i10 car. after some time Dad bought i20 too...actually the thing is it was the time when we were kinda grown up too and a car was necessary plus i hv four siblings so i20...mayb my uncle thought it was kinda a competition..childish i know. Bam! N then came d issue of d ""way"". see my dad , uncle, and dads elder brother , they all lived together before(joint fam)....Wen they seperatd land, they decided de sud leav 10 feet land for vehicle...lemme explain that bit. its like imaging three houses next to next and we need to leave path to the right so that we cn park beside respective house...the main entry being point being our uncle's because his house is first, middle dad then dads elder bro. my dads elder bro did(left 10feet to the side then constructed new house), dad did, he dint. N wen dad told, he said ""u dnt evn hav a car nw(then ). I will gv way wen u buy."" N my grandparents let him hav his way. Actually its all der fault. they never take d authority. N wen we bougt the car, he refusd straight. We dint hav place to keep our new car. We kept in a locality friend' house. Such emberasment. N uncle dint gv ""way"" all d tym. Dad didnt try to make an issue coz our grandparents wer der n he thought to make them approach n deal first.. they didnt. They wer too spineless. Its der land, de r parents de but dint hav d guts to tell my uncle ...hey "" you r wrng"". Dats why i hate dem when de dramatise to love dad when they need money. N things remaind same. Den grandpa was sick. then Dunno smthng hapnd, dads elder bro and another close relative were angry at my uncle for an issue. So they went to his house to talk. N he opend d door n said m busy go away and other rude things. she (relative ) slappd him. He hit her n broke her head. Den dad ran in(we lived next to each other so the ruckus is audible) .He broke dads nose n their head. All wer hurt but kept silent and tried to handle internally coz he is family. Bt he sent police, to arrest dem. D police laughd n went away, saying ""u beat them and den u cmplained?""....from then on der wer court cases n cases. so that was what happened. Problem now is he moved away and now his land is bought by another relative but he still comes and make a scene. plus he poisoned his kids like "" you arent allowed to say his name (dads) in house"". its like he is using that incident (land dispute n court cases) to dissipate all his jealousy and ego on my dad. coz there many ppl involved but he is just on my dad. i mean yeah you adults hv issues okay.. but dont spoil the next generation. i know this is getting too long n no specific questions is asked ..imma answer in comments if i get any reply lol. i just wanna get sm views and how would you handle this...plus advice because i dont wanna spoil the relationships between my cousins n us because of whatever is going on with the adults.

"How to help my mom make friends? My parents have had a rocky relationship since I've known them, some times worse than others. Over the years, my father's caustic conversationalism and other factors has caused my mom's friendships to fade away. She's been quite depressed in the past couple of years, although in a slightly better frame of mind lately. They're in their 50s and recently had to move 2 hours away from their longtime home for my dad's work, and my mom is rather isolated. How can I help her make friends? They live in the country and can't really even get internet at their house right now. My dad has mellowed slightly with age, and is *generally* well-intentioned but clueless as to how this affects her and what she needs. Any tips would be great.

"Why do I pick the worst friends? This is an absolute rant: I am frustrated and I don't have any friends apparently to work through this with so Reddit it is! What do you know? There I'd convieniantly a sub-reddit for this very issue I am having. First of all, I want to start off by saying, all of my friends are not terrible. The majority of them, yes. I feel like friends are supposed to add value and positive energy to your life and that is not happening in mine. It has been becoming clear over the last few months and I think I need to figure out how to dump these friends that drain me. Here are some examples. I will use letters instead of their names. Friend A. I have known A for about 10 years now. We worked together for many years. We partied together for many years. We have kept in contact for many years. I didn't see A as much when I moved about a half hour away. Life happens. Things happen. People get busy and I totally understand that. I drive, she STILL doesn't. We still remained friends though. However..... I am the one who checks up on her and messages to simply see how things are or invite her somewhere. She gets a hold of me when she needs a ride or something. I can't remember a time she has ever just called or texted to say hi and ask me how life is. I like A because she is pretty easy to talk to. We have had a lot of good times and have made a ton of memories. One thing that I always tried to look past is her utter lack of manners. I don't think in my ten years of knowing her I have ever heard her mutter a thank you. All of the things I have done for her, never once was there a thank you. I have given her tons and tons of rides and she has offered gas money and I never received a dime. I never expected a dime but if you are going to offer it at least honor your word. What really prompted this post was something that happened today. A is pregnant and she is due sometime in January. I hadn't heard from any of our mutual friends about planning a shower so I messaged her best friend and asked If she had thought about doing so. Her best friend hadn't even given it any thought. .... she said if I would like to take the reigns and plan it then she would help but had no interest in planning the party. I thought it was a little odd but I felt like A really should have a baby shower. I reached out to a few more people who I thought might have the same idea and they hadn't thought to do it either. I'll be honest, I am not a party planner. .. not even close. The thought of entertaining/interacting/etc with people makes me super anxious.... BUT all that aside... she is my friend and she deserves to be thrown a baby shower. I have been thinking about ideas over the past few weeks but haven't put anything into motion yet. I get a message from her today over Facebook that says: ""So H informed me you guy were gonna plan a babyshower for me...well we was unaware so C and R are getting together to do one...so if you would like get in touch with one of them and details can be worked out....we just know we are having it October 14th"" I read it. My first initial reaction was annoyance. Since then it has progressed... I think I would have been less annoyed if there was a ""but thank you for thinking of me anyways"" or something along those lines. There is not one ounce of gratitude in this message. I'm kind of annoyed with myself for expecting there to be any at all. One would think I would have learned by now. So, I guess the point of this rant is for me to figure out what I need to do about all of this. My gut is telling me it's time to ditch the ungrateful, mannerless nonsense. The other part is sad to lose a ""friend"". Are my expectations too high? Is it wrong of me to expect my friends to have basic manners? Please, any and all advice is welcomed.

"My dad says I'm careless but does nothing himself Basically my dad came into my room tonight saying that my mom over heard me and my brothers conversation. (we were talking about how hypocritical he is) He started to get really mad and started yelling at me because I never do anything the right way or enough. I usually go out to eat so Im like never in the kitchen, when he comes I to my room and starts screaming at me because I don't help around the kitchen I'm to scared to tell him that neither does he.... For example he had left his hot dog mess, rice mess, and his dishes in the living room all for us to clean up. Generally my mom would pick up after him and clean up but she is recovering from an injury that was quite serious. So when he comes into my room and yells at me, exaggerating the problem emmensly, for not helping out, I just want to scream in his face that he doesn't do anything and I'm always picking up after him... Continuing to tell me how careless and irresponsible I am. I get that I'm not perfect and I do forget some stuff but it just seems like I baby him and I get yelled at if I don't clean up after him.... Someone help me, how can I tell him that he's needs to clean up after himself!

"Why would people keep telling me âyouâre a good personâ, I donât feel like Iâm a good person. Yesterday my best friend sent me a text telling me âyouâre a good person, youâll find someone.â All I could think was no I donât want to find just someone, I wanna be with someone who resembles the guy I canât forget. Not anybody will do and if Iâm such a good person he would have stayed friends with me. My mother said everyone Iâm close with or knows me well including my aunt, relatives all of them wants me to take care of someone either their own daughter meaning my aunts and then other cases my elder sister because they could see I have a good heart but then she ended the conversation with when you have a lover/boyfriend youâll forget about me, about us. Which judging by past experiences her words has some truth in it. In my mind all of this is some kind of a cosmic joke because I donât think I would find someone like him whoâd be interested in me. This leads to nowhere, I feel so sick and tired of it all already their expectations and my lack of motivation to improve myself and poor sense of self-worth.

"Told my mother I tried to kill myself, she admitted she also tried when i was a baby. I've been struggling with this sickness for a while, it cost me my job, and a few friends, but only now i can publicly say that i tried to kill myself on the 19th of February. I tried to hang myself with a belt, fortunatelly i bought a really shitty one at primark and the only thing it did was leave me on the floor gasping desperatelly for air, filled with a sense of failure and a huge shame. I've always been an outgoing, funny, talkative and very active guy and i just felt as is i runned out of batery like something was leaving me without lifeforce. After some therapy i decided to tell my mother about this. I went for a visit to my parents house and waited until we were alone to tell her basically what i've been writing above. Also told her that the biggest fear i had before doing it was that if i died my mother would also died just out of pure sadness. After we both cried for a while she dropped the bomb. She had been struggling with depression all her life without me or my sister knowing about it and it came a point where she even tried of doing the same. The thing that stopped her was their children and what we would do with 12 and 8 years alone. She also told me that my grandfather didn't die of cancer, apparently he was an alcoholic, and when we where kids he threw himself at the well they had on the backyard. All this just made me realize that people don't kill themselves, depression kills people the same way cancer does. People who haven't struggled with this can't even imagine what is living with depression and often blame a person who is basically ill. My mother also gave me the best advice i've ever recieved. She told me that I wasn't on this earth just to find a job and live the best way i could just by buying things, that it didn't matter if i didn't find a huge reason to live; just by being there i was already the reason for my mother and many others to live and be happy, the same way she was for me. That even just by smiling at the guy at the supermarket i was already making him a bit happier even though it would only be a few seconds, and that should be enough. Thanks for listening guys

"Conservative republican parents &amp; liberal arts educated democrat child...what could go wrong? I grew up in a poor household, but was able to use this to my advantage to get scholarships to private school and an elite liberal arts college. After graduating from school and coming back home, I realized that I have absolutely nothing in common with my parents anymore. They do not understand the concept of privilege, think everyone on welfare is lazy, voted for Trump and defend him and every time I get legitimately pissed off at them, they say that the school I went to brainwashed me and made me crazy and in doing so they completely invalidate all the hard work and effort I had to put in not only to get into this school, but working two jobs while there and still maintaining a 3.5 GPA. I was a sociology major, too, so these issues are literally what I spent most of my four years studying. It's now at the point where I cannot have a conversation with my father without it blowing up. It gets worse by the issue and the WORST part is that they are decent and loving people. Is there anyone else on here who is in a similar situation? What do you do? I'm slowly losing my mind trying to argue at this point. And moving out is the obvious solution, but I don't just want to run away from people who disagree with me and like, I don't pay rent.

"I feel as though eventually I am going to kill myself Iâve told a couple friends this. Theyâve told me that I need to see my therapist more, and that I need to get back on my meds. But what if Iâm content with this thought? I donât remember the last time I was truly happy. At best Iâm content. Most of the time though Iâm in a shitty mood. I donât really give a fuck anymore that people might be upset that Iâd commit suicide. I definitely donât give a fuck when people get worried when I say that Iâm gonna do it eventually. It is what is. Iâm not happy, I never will be. When I tell my therapist that Iâll never be happy he asks me if I can predict the future. Obviously I fucking canât but if the last 15 years have been any indication of what my happiness is gonna be then it ainât gonna get any better With all of that said, and here I go contradicting myself, but all of what Iâve just previously wrote scares the absolute shit out of me. Iâm terrified that Iâm starting to give less of a fuck. Also, while I donât think Iâll ever truly be happy, I still have hope that I will be one day. But itâs not looking good

I have never done anything with a guy even though there have been so many opportunities presented to me, but I always say no. I want a boyfriend, I want to have sex. All my friends are in relationships. I think there is something wrong with me because I keep saying no to the things I want. I feel lonely.

"School is making me so stressed Itâs all the time. I fell asleep last night feeling okay about stuff but woke up anxious and depressed not wanting to go to my classes. I have been failing 2 of my most important classes and I just have no reason to keep going to them. Itâs finals week and Iâve been stressed about finals since school started. I donât even know if I want to stay in school anymore because I donât want to feel like this. Iâve also been slacking off so much on homework. It doesnât matter to me anymore it just feels so useless to do.

"I feel like Iâm spiraling downwards. Iâm losing people and canât do anything about it or do the wrong things. Iâm just searching desperately for someone to care before itâs too late. This summer has just flown by. I work so much and made the mistake of taking multiple summer classes. I spend every moment I can trying to do fun things with my friends but many times itâs not as much as Iâd like. My best friend is stationed overseas, and while I have a close group of friends Iâve known for years, literally all of them are doing something this fall that takes them elsewhere. When they are gone, Iâm going to be all by myself. Iâve been so lonely lately too. Just wanting someone to care about me. I had it and fucked it all up at the beginning of the year, and I just regret it all the time. I drink by myself a lot at night to deal with the loneliness, but it makes it worse. This summer has already just been shitty, but at least my friends are around. Itâs like fall is just a ticking time bomb at this point. No matter how hard I try to talk to someone new it never goes my way and Iâm always left on read or stood up on plans. The other night, I got drunk and did something Iâve never done before, and that was cut myself. Honestly, I feel like I did it to see if I could, and how it would make me feel. I guess I still donât know how it does, but I was disappointed in myself I let it get so far. I donât know. I just feel like this year has just been me slowly losing the only things that make me happy.

"My friend is a douchebag I donât know what to do about my friend. I guess you could say he is the âleaderâ of our friend group. Because of this, no one does anything when he pulls a dick move. Everyone seems to worship him. He never thinks anything is his fault, even when he can do the most fucked up thing. He has no respect for anyone, heâs extremely rude. I canât trust the guy cause heâll share your secrets to the whole group (including you) just to be funny. Heâs a major hypocrite. He bullies my other friend. This guy has been pretty much my best friend for a very long time, and I donât know what to do. He says Iâm his best friend, and it seems like that when itâs only me with him, but when there are other people there, he just leaves me in the dust, even though he always complains about when his friends hang out with someone else (like I said heâs a hypocrite). He makes me feel like a worthless piece of shit sometimes. I want to stop being friends with this guy, but heâs friends with all of my other friends. I canât even seem to get him out of my life if I even try (our parents are pretty good friends). I just donât have no idea what to do. Any advice would be greatly apprecited. By the way Iâm in high school.

"Do you ever feel like why bother weâre all going to die anyhow and all weâve accomplished and done will be forgotten? I enjoy art, but I often think why bother. Iâll die one day and all my art work will be thrown away. Thereâs a lot I do enjoy but none of it serves any purpose. After you go on vacation for example youâre just left with the memories, until you get old and forget it all. Sure it was fun at the moment but serves no long term purpose and one day even the memories will be gone. They say enjoy life but why? Animals donât. They just do what they do. Theyâre only purpose is to keep their species alive and technically thatâs our only purpose in life to keep our species going. Maybe if we didnât spend so much time focusing on life and enjoying it weâd actually be happier people and more accepting of pending doom.

"Hey reddit, give me one moment. Take a deep breath. Release yourself of your roles and see yourself as a person dealing with other people. Take a moment right now, take a deep breath and appreciate how there is so much effort taken in making the world as it is. We harnessed the elements and made the surface of the world a little more enjoyable. Sit back and enjoy all this hard work. Strip the world off from labels. People do not mean to be good or bad. Remember that after you acomplish (or not) all your goals we are still people living with other people. Remember today. Take another deep breath, if you are comfortable, close your eyes. Appreciate whats around you, good or bad. Maybe the day is really ugly. Remember again that it is on around its own business. Do not see it about yourself, but instead look at your role in the big picture. Have a smile. You deserve it ;)

"Advice on where to post for advice on taking antidepressants. Hi, UK based poster - I've recently taken my Doctors advice and got a prescription for antidepressants. I've been in-and-out of various states of mild to severe depression throughout my teens &amp; twenties, but I've always figured this is just something everyone has to deal with at some stage or another, so I've never sought help even when falling off a proverbial cliff edge. After much deliberation, someone I care deeply about got me to try counselling, but I find that I'm really not getting much out of it right now, as I don't have the will to try, and my focus is all over the place (I'm being tested for ADHD too, but I'm still awaiting the results). My Doctor suggested trying a combination of antidepressants and CBT (the latter of which I am currently attempting to source a support group for), however I have an underlying phobia of long-term medication after seeing several people close to me, use it as a crutch and just become something wholly unfamiliar to me as a result. I've been prescribed Citalopram (Celexa for those stateside) but like I said - I have deep-seated reservations about taking them and before I tried, I wanted to see if there was anywhere/anyone I could talk to about their experiences on the drug and any perhaps any suggestions they could offer about managing short-term (6-9 months) antidepressant medication? I've looked at the sub-reddit rules for this group and I'm not sure if this crosses rule 3; if so, can someone help me find the right place to ask my question(s)?

"How to break up with my depressed/suicidal girlfriend? Iâm in a tough position... I fell for a girl over 6 months ago and weâve been dating since. Itâs faded for me at least, and I donât feel the same way I did at all, but from what sheâs told me her feelings for me have only gotten stronger and weâve already hit the âI love youâ stage. I still care for her as a person and thereâs nothing bad between us nor do we argue, but itâs just not what it was and I feel like Iâve needed to move on for the past 2-3 months. My issue with this is the fact that sheâs both depressed and has been suicidal in the past (not things I knew off the bat, but learned towards the beginning). She has 1 real friend and a sibling sheâs close to, but aside from that she doesnât get along with her family. Sheâs told me before Iâm really all she has, but not in a desperate way (although I think it is that too). I donât really know how to tell her or what to be cautious of because this is the first time Iâve dated someone like this. I know itâs a shitty situation but I need to move on in a way that leaves her the least impacted or in the best way I can. I havenât done anything like cheat on her or hurt her emotionally but I know this will crush her either way...

"I don't want to exist anymore My girlfriend has left me a couple of months ago, saying she doesn't love me anymore but without explaining me why. I then tried to ask her out one last time, not to come back together, just to clarify what happened. She doesn't want to see me and when I write to her she answers back just so that I can't say she's ignoring me and she continuously provokes me to get into an argument. I really had trusted her, and she had done the same, until a couple of months ago (she's always told me I was the only person who she actually trusted, even after we split up) so I feel like I've been used and then thrown away like an object. I then realized I'm not good at all at socializing, that she was the only truly important person in my life (except for other two friends of mine, who have their own lives and whom I don't want to annoy too much with my problems) and that I will probably never know anyone else in my life. Every day I feel like I'm bothering other people and I'm not doing anything good, and probably this is the reason nobody wants to become my friend. I don't want to commit suicide, but often I find myself thinking how better it would be if I stopped existing...

"I'm just so fucking lonely and I'm tired of pretending I'm fine Fair warning I'm about to just spill out everything I have bottled up into this post I'm so tired of being alone I can't bare it anymore. My depression and anxiety is slowly killing me. I'm a 23 year old male, trying to restart my adult life in college after many failed attempts at succeeding anywhere else. I work and I go to school, I see hundreds of smiling and happy faces, and I feel like I'm not even really there with them. Like a one way mirror where I see them but I'm never seen. I have no friends. I used to be a part of rather large group of friends, but as of now I couldn't tell you the last time I talked to any of those people. They've either moved on and some of them are no longer on this earth. I have acquaintances with people at work, but they have their own life to live and when it's time to clock out, again I am left to go home alone and broken. The only person I ""have"" is my mother, and she tends to make matters worse when I try to open. I'm also desperately single. I haven't been in a relationship, let alone just dated someone, in years. And it's soul crushing. I see all these happy couples around campus, beautiful men and women, having the time of their lives with each other. And I'm so fucking jealous man. I want that happiness so desperately bad. I want to love someone, I want to FEEL loved! I want someone to help me through days like today, and to be there for them when they have those days. I want the cheesy shit like cuddling and laughing over stupid stuff. I want the inevitable times where we're pissed at each other about something, but we work through it and end up going crawling up next to each other in bed at the end of the night, and wake up to see each other to start the day. I'm tired of waking up to this massive empty bed, cold and alone. But most of all, I'm tired of pretending. Of having to pretend. To wear this mask every single fucking day of my life just to pretend to be normal. Just so my coworkers won't think I'm weird. Just so my mom won't go off about how I just need to get my shit together. Just so I can hold up the chance that one day I'll be able to overcome my massive wall of social anxiety and try to talk to someone, make a friend, maybe meet a girl. All in all I'm tired of pretending I'm happy, that I'm fine. BECAUSE IM NOT FUCKING FINE! I'm not happy, I'm slowly dying over here and I can't take this shit anymore. I desperately want to change. I desperately want to live a ""normal"" life, and I just keep sinking further and further down while everyone else passes me by. I guess my rant is over. Thanks for reading if you made it this far.

"In law family vacation + newborn My husband and I have been married since August 2016. I am now pregnant due in April. We have been going on vacation with his parents for the last 3 yrs with his 2 sisters and last year their husband's too. They assume that we will be going on vacation this year too, the baby would be 4 months old I DONT WANT TO GO. FYI, his dad is great and hands off and his mom is very opinionated and gives too much advice but she means well and has been nothing but good to me. Reasons I don't want to go 1. We have lived with them for the past 5 months, I need a vacation from THEM. I am used to my own space and being able to retreat, I no longer really have that. 2. It will be a 4 hr car ride with a four month old. It may not be that big a deal but other than the car ride, I just rather be home and comfortable and not in another state staring at a beach for 7 days that I don't even want to be at. 3. My husband's older sister has gone out of her way to make me feel excluded in the past and said borderline mean comments. We made some headway last year but I barely tolerate her and avoid her and really don't want to be stressed out for 7 days because of it plus taking care of My baby. Everyone else doesn't see this, or sees her aggressive behavior as assertive. 4. I don't even know why I've gone the last 3 years as by the 3rd day I am drained. I am trying to better listen to myself instead of forcing myself to endureeat something I don't have to My question is how do I tell them we are not going (my husband is backing me 100%) specially cause I know my MIL will resist Do you guys think it's ok that I don't want to go

"I think my friends ditched me. I was recently doing a mass unfollowing on Instagram and I noticed a lot of people that I went to high school and college with are no longer following me. Same thing with Facebook. I donât blame them because Iâm boring and they are either married with kids or theyâre just out to the hottest bar or club every damn weekend. I donât drink nor am I in a relationship or married. Where does a 29 year old go to make new friends and even find the love of their life? I failed to find her in school or work. Am I just doomed to roam the planet a loner who only can have internet friends. Sure itâs cool at first but I need real friends to talk to and someone to marry for real.

"My friend wants to use my house, so she can be alone with her boyfriend. Should i let her? So, my friend's got a boyfriend. They're in the ""lovey dovey"" phase right now, and they really want to consummate their relationship, i think they should wait until they're 18, but it's their choice to make. Anyway, my conflict is this. They want to have sex, but they have nowhere to do it at. They're too poor for a hotel, and both their parents watch them like hawks whenever they're together. Plus, she gets taken too and from school, and her parents chaperone her everywhere else, since she doesn't have a car yet (they are making her work for her vehicle). As for him, his dad never leaves the house, and he has an ""open door"" rule, meaning they have to be where they can be seen and all doors open at all times at his house. The only time her parents aren't watching her is when she's with me, we hang out a lot on the weekend, so they let her spend the night at my house often, because of my situation on the weekends. On the weekends, my mother works late evening/nights, and she's gone until almost 6 in the morning. My father is sometimes their on the weekend, but he's often away, for months at a time (he's a trucker), he's gone right now actually. (THey let her stay with me so i can have company at home, when my parents are gone) So, i'll be alone this weekend. Earlier today, her boyfriend came up to me and asked if they could ""do the deed"" in my house this weekend while my parents are out, he knows of my situation as well. They both want this, they practically begged me. I told them i would think about it. So, should i allow this?

I did spend time with friends Friday and Saturday, but the majority of the time I just sit at home and watch youtube or do some other dumb shit. I've been trying to quit drinking and smoking weed, but they really numbed the weekend away to make it bearable. Now I'm just a sad sap with nothing to do. I am trying to take up hobbies to fill the time but it seems pointless. The worst part is that I have had some really good days this week and I thought that maybe I was better. The depression is worse after I've felt genuinely happy for the first time in a long time. I've been overwhelmed with cravings for alcohol all weekend and I've been trying to get some homework done, but all I can focus on is wanting to drink.

"Journal Entry - 12:23AM Monday, December 4th, 2017 Just thought I'd share my thoughts from last night. I occasionally lurk Reddit looking for a relatable story, so I figured I'd share some of my own thoughts. I don't want a job. The hardest part of having a job is talking. It's bad enough that I have to make eye contact. Having to speak on top of that can be nerve wrecking. Meeting new people is also tough. It's even tougher when you're the new one. Who are these people? Do I even want to know you? Are you going to try and get to know me? Am I going to allow it? Customers are easier to deal with, but just a drag to have to deal with. It can be monotonous. Often, itâs annoying. But all the while, I just feel drained. There are good days at work. But there are also bad days. And those bad days make the lasting impression, in my experience. I'm thankful for those good days. But the bad days remind me that I want better for myself. I'm tired of working in restaurants. I'm tired of wearing a stupid hat my hair can barely fit under. I'm tired of repeating phrases I'm told to repeat. I'm tired of seeing the disgusting process of how peopleâs shitty food is prepared. I'm tired of cooking, something I enjoy, feeling soulless. Historically, preparing a meal and feeding someone is a virtuous act, at least to me. The commoditization of it is a bit of a shame. I detest consumerism, generally speaking. Customers are not my favorite people. Along with restaurants, I hope to avoid customer interaction at my next job. I really don't want any job. When it comes to time &amp; energy vs. money, I'm all for the money until I find out what I have to do. Then my my time &amp; energy feels more valuable. Because it is more valuable.

"In the mood to vent So I'm gonna make this self deprivating post quick. I was a sick child. Shit was fucked. Too young to understand what was going on and had lots of surgeries and what not. I possibly have autism, I was diagnosed with sensory processing disorder to get O.T. however I think they gave me that so I wasn't stuck with the label of autism. I think they believed I was too young to be diagnosed and so I never got a checkup from a psychiatrist after O.T. . So it's possible I'm autistic but idk. Anyway my childhood was shit. Absolute fucking garbage. I was the loser kid. Had physical issues so I never left the house. I was ugly and fat. My entire childhood was just a big fucking waste of time. Anyway I become 16 and start hanging around bad kids. At this point I lost all fucks to give about my schooling. My social skills were finally developed enough so I can make friends but I didn't really like any of them. I started getting a prescription for drugs. It wasn't very difficult given my medical history. Started taking Adderall daily. And my mom would occasionally give me some Xanax she had. Also started drinking. I guess some warning signs for a shitty life but idk. I'm not entirely sure what to do at this point. I plan on going to community college since I'm probably gonna drop out of HS soon. I just don't think I'm ready for the real world. I always feel like I'm that one person who just can't adapt to things.

"My little brother was in pain and I didn't help him I need to get something off my chest that I haven't talked to anyone about before. It's about a situation, where my mother freaked out over my little brother's bratty behaviour. He was about 5 years old and throwing a fit, he was in a really bad moment, he kicked my leg, and all those things weren't pretty. Something must have been bothering him, usually he is a very wonderful person, funny and smart, but just threw a tantrum like every kid does once in a while. When he called me a bitch (his big sister, and I might even have been teasing him) my mother totally freaked out, she scolded him loudly and he already started crying. She went outside to the car and took out his car seat and said she wouldn't need it anymore now that he's not part of the family anymore but will be taken away by child services. He stood on the front porch and cried his heart out and screamed to my mother ""I don't want to go to the welfare home"" (that's what it was called to him apparently) and he sobbed so desperately and feared for his life and safety. And my mom then looked at him sternly and asked him to apologize and then they hugged and made up. It is probably the most painful thing in my life. I know he might already have forgotten it and he gets along quite well with my mother (he's a teenager now), but I do think back to that moment and feel that stabbing pain in my chest, as I was standing there passively and watching my mother use him emotionally. He was so fragile and vulnerable, and if I could, I would just wrap him in my arms and love and comfort him, until there's no sadness left in him.

"I donât think I was cut out to survive in the world. I canât make phone calls. I canât drive. I canât get a job and work like everyone else. I get stressed out and anxious over everything.

"Im wasting my life As a 15 year old currently, I feel like i'm entirely disconnected from every human soul on this planet. I cannot properly have social interactions with others without me overthinking stuff that person says. What I mean is, if a ""friend"" tells me i'm dumb jokingly, I take it at heart. I take everything too literal, I cannot properly talk to others without me being awkward and silent. I cannot talk to people if I have ignore them constantly, if someone addresses me so they can talk to me, I sometimes ignore them and pretend like I never heard them. If a person says hi to me, I stay silent. I'll never get a girlfriend, i'll never feel a girls hand, or the feeling of affection, comfort, and attention. I never even got to talk to a girl before. Seeing everyone at school socializing with their girlfriend, hugging them, doing everything for them, absolutely destroys me as a person. I can see why I got bullied. Those times I was called ""Pussy"" ""Weak"" ""Retarded"" turned out to be true. The physical bullying I received, when they pulled my hair and embarrassed me in front of everyone in class by flipping me off my chair. I understand now, the stuff I deserve. I can see why my dad abondoned me ever since I was born, he was never there for me, I don't know what type of man he is or how he looks like. The brothers and sisters I never met, which I dearly wish I could. They're all so young, I wish I could have been a big brother for them. I hate living in isolation and loneliness. As if I wasn't lonely enough at school, but now at home. Everyone takes their brothers and sisters for granted, but a person like me would love one of those. My grandparents and mom say they love me, which I do believe, but I still feel no more or less that same, it doesn't matter in the end. I cannot do simple activities at school that involve groups, no because a person could possibly screw it up for us, but because I need to socialize. I cannot do sports because it involves me being around people and I absolutely despise it. What am I so afraid of? Being judged? Why am I here? What am I? It doesn't matter, I still die in the end anyways. Maybe taking my own life is the answer, it resolves all the pain I have received. Who cares what my so called family feels? They must know its for my own personal benefit, they should realize that when I do eventually end myself, that I will no longer feel the pain I once received. I never have felt an emotional connection between any of my family, they're doing their own thing in their life. Nobody at school would care, I only have two friends. Ones I hold dear because they understand my pain. Looks are deceiving aren't they? A lot of people in my school consider me attractive and cute, but good does that do me? I won't get any benefit from it either way. A bit of a description of how I look like, long hair, feminine face, a thin appearance (not super thin, I weigh about 130). But anyways, I simply plan on ending my own life sooner or later, I don't know how long I can last. We have no value, no significant purpose of existing, so might as well end it now. I constantly wear this mask where i pretend i'm happy, when i'm not. The only thing I do with my life is listen to Joy of Mans Desiring in bed, contemplating my existence.

"The Time My Friend Betrayed Me This happened at my high school. I had a fractured finger so I wasn't allowed to do gym. During gym they were playing soccer. My friend knows I really like this guy and she start flirting with him and started hugging him for no reason and I ended up crying because this was so upsetting to me. I confronted her about it and she said she didn't mean so I forgave her. About 4 months ago I got a boyfriend and she started flirting with him and he didn't even care, he flirted back at her. and I went home crying and I decided to break up with the guy and stopped being friends with her for good because I realized that she was flirting with that guy I liked.

He's a 50+ Catholic Indian (the country; and yes, they exist) who's lived in Chicago since he was 20. I'm a 20 something millennial born and raised in the States. But that's all fine; we have our arguments, but at the end of the day we love each other. Lately, though, my little sister (in high school) has been getting into her own arguments with our dad.

She always wants to hang out with me everyday and if I say I don't want to she will beg me because she knows 9 times out of 10 I will cave in.

Not only when it comes to dating but also friendships as well as many other things. We prefer attractive people over unattractive ones no matter the context. My parents aren't ugly, my sister isn't ugly, I have no idea why I'm as ugly as I am. It kills me to think about what others think about my looks. I absolutely hate it.

"Losing my brother My brother died suddenly Friday night. He was 38. He was pretty much estranged from most of the family, spent some years making bad decisions and doing drugs and it caught up to him. He was trying to straighten out his life and cut out drugs and negative friends, from what Iâd heard. He was in the ICU recently with heart failure and pneumonia. We talked while he was in the hospital, a lot of apologies and crying and encouragement, just a brother and sister having a conversation. The next day his blood pressure was supposedly good enough for him to be released. 10 days later, he was gone. My family members are taking it in their own ways. We all had unresolved things, a relationship we were hoping to rekindle, a bond I wanted to forge again with my big brother. He was my best friend and hero growing up. My biggest challenge as an adult. I feel so much regret and heartache over this, I canât even begin to explain. He didnât have an easy life. We lost a lot, he went through a lot, some of it was because of his choices, I really feel he was trying to make it right but it was just too late. We lost our grandpa and dad in the last 2 years, now my brother who was the first born grandson. I donât think Iâll ever get over this.

"Am I going insane or is this normal? Zoning out I was always praised for my memory. Didn't ever revise for exams but I'd still get good grades. Nowadays not so much. I'm constantly 'zoning out'. It's got to the point where I sometimes forget what happened 30 seconds ago. I'll be in shower and zone out for 30 seconds, come back and I can't remember if I washed my hair or not. It's always simple things like that. I still have no problem with studies, remembering appointments and generally anything that matters. Yet, I still check if I closed the fridge door 3 times within a few minutes... Am I just getting older? Can this be a symptom of depression or perhaps something more sinister? I feel like this is something I've always had and perhaps everyone else has too, but lately it just seems too frequent to be normal...

"Will my best friend come back because of this reason? In about April my best friend cut me off from her life, we were friends for nearly 7 months and we were so close, had a really strong bond, and the only time we wouldn't talk to eachother whether it'd be facetime, messenger or call as well as trying to see eachother as often as possible, was when we would sleep. Otherwise, we were always talking to eachother and we cared for and loved eachother a great deal and did heaps for eachother but yeh she did in fact cut me off because I didn't reply to her messages one day. Anyway we haven't communicated at all since then but I sent her a letter for this year 12 camp we did so it's a graduation letter dedicated to her. I told her I would send it to her when we were friends and I'm not sure if she's forgotten but it is going to be sent to her. The contents of it go along the lines of thanking her, stating how much I appreciate her and that I'll always be there for her no matter the situation in 1 1/2 pages. I'm not 100% but could this possibly bring me and her back to being friends again?

"What are ways to connect to a close person who is depressed ? Iâve been dating a girl for 7 months and Iâve notice her cycle of moving close to me then pushing me away . She gets secluded, and almost checked her self into a hospital last month but she has never really opened up about the complex feelings so Iâm wondering how can help relate ? How can get her to know Iâm here to listen and attempt to understand . I tell her often how special she is to me, I get her flowers at her doorstep, I show the love but recently, Iâm trying to connect a different way. She is currently pushing me away again, so I asked to take her out to dinner the tomorrow, no response . I wonât give up on her but I want to make sure the next moves are in the right direction . I want to walk by her side thru this journey . I wonât give up on her either . So any insight on how to be a good friend during a depressed state of mind would be amazing , thank you

"Got the news I was 100% cancer free (again) last week, but I feel more emptier and lonelier than ever before. I'm not sure what's wrong with me, I know I have a great support system and I should be happy that I'm far away from the crutches of painful chemo and surgeries, but I just can't fill the void inside. I feel incredibly lonely and miserable, I barely can rack about 3 hours of sleep a night and at school I feel like an idiot because I can barely focus on anything. Anyways, maybe beating cancer isnt really something to be ""proud"" of. I'm no fucking warrior. I'm terrified about the whole thing.

"What can I do in this situation? After graduating high school last summer, I stopped hanging out with all my friends. Some just stopped contacting me since they now live far away living in dorms and such..and others I dropped because they were fake. Sometimes I do sort of regret it, but that's only because of the loneliness and boredom I feel home alone on a weeknight. I'm currently taking a year off and I only have one close friend. I've only known this friend for a year but we got along so well. We had soo many things in common. But now I feel like he's super fake. For ex, he talks crap about his ""friends"" but then posts photos and acts all nice and friendly around them. When he talks about them with me, it genuinely sounds like he hates them and says he never wants to hangout with them..but then does??. Not only that, but nowadays whenever we hang all he seems to do is complain and judge other people. Like, at first it use to be ok..but now it's all the time. It's so toxic and just a cheap form of communication imo. He's also always late whenever we schedule a meetup. Not once was he ever on time, sometimes he makes me wait an hour because he took his time to get ready when he knows that I'm waiting for him. We also never get to do what I want to do anymore because he's ""lazy"". For ex, I really wanted to go to this cute cafe and he also did too..but then on the day of he was taking so long to get ready we ended up not having time to go. We only get to do what I want if he's benefitting from it. Just thinking about this makes me wanna go to him right now and let out all my anger at his face. I do confront him, but it's almost as if he forgets. I would tell him that I hate it when he makes fun of my body or rubs whatevers on his hands on my shirt as if it's a tissue but then a couple weeks later he'll do it. ugh. Just recently too..he was telling me about his cousin and how she literally talks crap about everyone which led to me asking if she ever talked about me. He said yes and she basically called me weird just because of my face shape. I know it's nothing serious but it made me mad because I'm super self conscious about it. But what made me even more mad was the fact that my so called ""friend"" didn't even stick up for me. He didn't tell her to stop or anything. Sorry that this turned into a rant, but I really wanted some advice. I feel so lonely. When he hangout I feel as I have to be this super fun person because he seems to talk about how his other friends are so fun when he hangs out with me. It wasn't always like this..maybe we're growing apart from each other, I don't know, but I'm purposely taking a break from him for two weeks..we scheduled a meetup for his bday but idk how that'll go. Any advice or opinions are welcome. I just want to hear what others think about my situation. Thanks.

"Long Winded Post From a Failed 30 Year Old I don't even necessarily want to write this but I need to clear my head. I've been a depressed pissant for as long as I could remember. Some of my youngest memories are melancholic and sickly devoid of confidence or even reason. I grew up dirt poor. I remember spending a night pushing a needle through the rubber of my shoes to get the sole back on. My mom had a stroke and an aneurysm but survived. Sort of. She became a wicked, wicked creature who loved pitting me against my sibling and I never came out on top. My entire life has been from the cowering creature perspective. Life isn't experienced but something that happens to me. I joined the Army at 18. I had gotten recklessly married a month prior to shipping to basic. I ended up fucking up and missing a bus which led to a Lemony Snicket series of Unfortunate Events type shit. I went through partial infantry brainwashing but never made it past the build-up. So I ended my career, the only thing I've wanted to do, before it even took off. Luckily, it was more of a ""this isn't working so we'll forget it happened"" type deal and my enlistment ended without anything terrible. But I never recovered. At least back then I had some sort of tenacity. Now? I'm a fucking shell, mate, of what I was. A completely hollow individual. I'm 30 years old. I've no education. I have no passions. I used to enjoy writing but I can't bring myself to write anymore. The moment I try I go back into wounded animal mode. No, this isn't good enough. Nope, neither is this. Why bother? Why try? I can't help but think these things. I'm still married and that is the only reason I haven't killed myself. I did try early on because of relentless hounding from my father in law. It is obvious I'm not what he wanted for his daughter. I can't figure out why I'm alive at all. I can barely live my life. I'm depressed constantly. No matter how happy I know I should be or how wide I smile I'm in the grey of storm clouds that seemed, at least until this subreddit, to be only over my head. I've had so many jobs that I just explosively quit. I've got Intermittent Explosive Disorder as well as depression and anxiety. So I coil up and wind tightly before my brain dumps chemicals that make me explode with no regard for the damage done. I'm currently unemployed. I left my last job like that. I loved my job. I loved the guy I worked for. I earned several raises within a few months and was promoted quickly because I threw my back into that work. It has been too long though. I can't seem to find another job. I can't even bring myself to apply anymore. I don't have a car. I ""rent"" a couple rooms off the main house of my inlaws. I failed so hard in giving my wife a life worth living. She spends her time working and though understands and doesn't mind my unemployment it is killing me. On Dec.12th I lost all interest in anything. I used to escape in video games but now I can't. I load up Ark and just stare. I've anxiety about everything. Recently installed Heroes of the Storm and I played a mean Lili and Abathaur but now I've got butterflies even playing against bots. The smallest, most simple of tasks seems beyond me. I'm stupider than I used to be. How I interpret the simplest of sentences or instruction is out of whack. I have trouble reading though I've got tons of read Omnibuses from Warhammer 40k on my bookshelf. I have trouble speaking. I talk slowly and can barely push out the words off my tongue. I'm only recently able to make phonecalls without losing my mind anxiety wise. I'm so full of regret. I hate what I became. I hate that I married someone and am dragging them through the mud. To never have a real apartment or car. I can't hold a job. I barely take care of the house. I do dishes now but it is a real struggle. I've been thinking a lot more about suicide and I'm already sure I am too cowardly to really do it but I think about it a lot. How it'd hurt my wife but I think it'd be good for her to find someone else. I just don't see the point in continuing. I'm an adult now but I never learned how to properly be an adult. I don't know what to do. There is a burning hole in my chest and I feel guilty that I'm the way that I am. Even on the subreddit. I know people feel that people who've a significant other can't be as depressed but I'm swimming at the bottom of the barrel. I want this all to end. I don't know how to survive. I don't know how people manage it. I don't have that self-preservation sense that keeps people going despite it all. I'm weak. I am weak in ways that I can barely accept. I struggle a lot with the fact 22 veterans a day kill themselves but I'm still around. I carry endless guilt that better people die and I'm still alive. Goddamn it. People are dying from diseases and cancers while I exist. While I can't so much as go outside without feeling like all eyes are boring holes into my psyche. I hate that all I do is sit here and lay in bed. I hate myself. I feel if I don't get this out, even if it is never seen by anyone, I will implode. I'm on medication and it helped my depression but then the reality

"Help me figure this out So Iâm a single mom I left my boyfriend because of us arguing all the time. He has my son two days out of the week and for his birthday I gave him three to be nice (thereâs a reason I donât want him having more bc he can not handle stress) but when he dropped my son off he told me he now wants him for a week meaning I have my son one week and he gets the other but I donât want that because I think it would be too stressful for my 10 month old so I told him Iâll take him to court which the father does not want . Things have smoothed over but I still want to go to court so this arguing over days will stop but I do not want to fuck myself over due to not having a job . I live with my mom and have a stable household but having him 5 days out of the week itâd be hard for me to get a job that will work with me . If we go to court Iâd allow him three days that way I can get a decent amount of work time but if I go to court without having a job or a car would that fuck me over and give the father more time ?

"All my friends have left me behind My best friends at school got new computers that can run AAA games and it was my idea. They soon all got gta and im stuck with this laptop. After this things started going downhill. i wasnt getting added to skype calls, when i asked, they said ""gta players only"" and when i slipped in one time i asked ""when are you guys ever going to play with me again"" either they didnt say anything or said ""i dont know"" and then one of my friends said ""we will play with you at school"". I have school tommorow btw. This has occured 4 days ago and each day i have gotten more sad. I have been trying to cope for it by trying to find new friends (which i did but they live in other countries so its hard to find playtimes) and also contacting old friends. I have asked my friends each day if they wanted to play and they say idk or maybe. i dont want to kill myself but i dont want it to come to that. Thats why im reaching out here. what should i do? im so scared and confused.

"Too cowardice or just selfish? So English is not my first language so there might be some grammar mistakes but this has been bugging me for a while now. There was this girl I met some time during my last year of middle school and I guessed she took an interest in me, I was pretty confused as I wasn't the type to stand out much and I wouldn't talk at all unless someone comes up and starts a conversation with me. And she was the one to do that - uh, during a school graduation ceremony, of course. After that, we went to different high schools but still kept in touch. So overtime, after the graduation, we kind of became close, as friends. Well I didn't have many friends to start with so I spent a lot of time talking to her about all kind of stuff and I was devoted, if she was sad I would spend my day trying to cheer her up or yes, I wouldn't push her to say what was on her mind if she didn't want to share but yeah, I could do anything to make her happy because as I said before, I didn't have many friends, I was bullied and she was the first one to be so kind to me - all my ""friends"" kind of just sided with the bullies when they knew I was the target. At one point, I thought I was in love with her. But that was the part I would feel guilty whether it came up, I thought because she was the popular type, and she had a boyfriend, dating her was something I could never do. But then she broke up with her boyfriend (it was some kind of argument over some disagreements iirc), I was happy about it but it just wasn't the right time, she was sad and she would spent the whole summer the following year after we met just talking with me about stuff and as we could do some drawings, we kind of made a world of our own and we would stay up until 2 in the morning everyday just to think of a concept for that universe (it's like making a comic or something, I'm a big nerd for world concepts) so it was like I was bonded with her. Anyways I think I'm being too informative about this so I'll just skip to the main point. After that, about 6 months or so I tried to be an understanding friend and I didn't take a single opportunity to try to flirt with her as I knew I would be a dick if I had done that - well because I thought I shouldn't pressure her into a relationship whereas she just got out of one. So anyways, after a year, she got over it, I thought it was the right time for me but I didn't have the confidence to confess because I was overprotective of her as she didn't/doesn't have a good family and I was more like a big brother to her, because she was the one who wasn't good with dealing problems and I've lived my whole life dealing with all kinds of problems so I had a good view of dealing with them (I won't go into details as it would be another really long story) - So the idea of us dating was kind of ridiculous - I still don't know if she ever felt the same way. So I tried to change for the better, I went out to socialize more (it was exhausting but hey, there are things you would do for love), I worked out to lose weight so she doesn't feel embarrassed if we were to get together (she doesn't say it but I know she doesn't even want to date a fat guy) - I wanted to be a good partner for her, I know I wouldn't be the best but I could try. I tried to be someone reliable because I know full well she kind of looked down on me, how she tried to prove that she's better than me at everything (she is, at some fields). But the distressing part was that she started changing, she is still popular (yup, up until now), but she had more outbursts, she was constantly crying and whether I came up to ask her what was wrong she would throw a fit at me so I thought I was invading her privacy too much so I didn't say anything anymore, I was just there, trying to be supportive. So for the second time, I let go of another opportunity for a girlfriend. (you can actually skip the first two parts but I just felt like going into details, sorry) The third time, I thought it was time to make a move and she met a girl and fell in love with her instantly, I was supportive of her regardless. The latter one was also attracted to her so I thought just what kind of person would be so selfish to stop their bestfriend from getting in another relationship. I mean, honestly, I never had any luck with girls so I could just wait for later, her being happy was my priority. Yeah, so ever since I tried to change, I was better at talking. So I helped them get together, how to reply just to get the other one to be her girlfriend. And after that, our friendship was getting better. I thought I was the happiest person at the time, but another part of me was devastated. That part was well hidden for quite some time but it grew, it hated her girlfriend, it hated the fact that I was being too devoted and never got anything in return (I didn't quite expect anything in return from the start but I guess my feelings piled up). And before I knew

I don't know what to do to get help, given that, while I live on my own, I'm not on my own health insurance and I don't want my parents involved. What if I did get help? The doctor would probably run me through a variety of medications that could have bad side effects.

I took a chance last year and despite depression I reached for a goal, which was me taking my first full-time job in the field I went to college for.

I'm facing the very real possibility of total failure.

"Ready to just say ""fuck it"" I can't take it anymore. I'm an atheist democrat living in a family of hardcore christian conservatives. Ive made it clear that Im a democrat, to which they just call me a snowflake all the time, which just makes me resent them even more. I dont dare tell them Im am atheist, but Im thinking about it. I dont have anything to live for anymore. I dont have any idea what to do with my life. I dont have any special talent or skills. The only hobby I really have is video games, but Im horrible at those. I've raged so hard at Battlefield that I broke down in tears and drooled everywhere, and anytime I play an RPG I restart so many times that it makes me not want to play anymore. All my friends have at least an idea of what they want to do, but I dont even have the beginnings of a clue as to what I want to do with the rest of my life. And to be honest, Im scared of becoming an adult. Managing a budget, doing taxes, paying bills, and shit like that. Im not fucking prepared for it. If I cant deal with the stress of a fucking video game, then I sure as hell cant deal with a job. My parents are also hounding me to get a girlfriend. I dont even have a friend who is a girl. All my close friends are male. Hell, the closest Ive came to having a full conversation with a girl is helping her with spanish homework. I aint gay, I just cant talk to girls. The social anxiety makes me want to vomit if I even think about approaching a girl. So Im ready to fuck it all and just tell my parents Im an atheist. Let them send me to whatever fucking counseling they want. Let them disown me and have to go live with a friend. I have no future other than a goddamn walmart greeter at this point

"Asian parents, jealousy, what to do? Hello I am an asian american son trying to help out my family. My family from Vietnam moved here 5 months ago and have been living together with my Mom and Dad. I no longer live at home, and couldn't live at home if I wanted to because of the space and my relatives here for the first time to America, which is fine with me. I recently found out about drama going on at home, it involves my mom and dad and my female cousin. About one ago before my relatives moved here from vietnam, something had happen to my great aunt , she had given advice to my mom about being careful about her husband and any woman in the house. What had happen to my great aunt was, she caught her husband trying to cheat with her niece. I'm not sure if they actually had an affair or whatnot, but just warning her to be careful about this type of situation in the house. I really feel like it was unfair for my great aunt to put these thoughts in my mom's head because why do that? Especially when they are about to come and move in and start a new life in America. So back to the drama, my dad has been super stress out calling me, telling me that he is unable to handle the situation anymore. He said my mom thinks he is looking at my female cousin in a inappropriate way. She happens to be 19 years old. My dad just thinks this is crazy, he works 2 jobs (15 hours a day) trying to pay mortgage and pay all the bills. My mom doesn't work and stays home. My dad has been calling me saying he only is able to sleep 4 hours a night because every time he comes home from work, my mom is always giving him a ear full, and hes to the point where he can't take it anymore and thinking about just continuing to pay the bills and living somewhere else. I tried to talk to my mom and want to be completely open minded about the situation, she just tells me that I dont know, and she can tell the way he acts at home. Her reasoning is, she just can tell by the way he looks at her. She said she knows that he won't ever take it that far by cheating, but its her being jealous which is causing all this drama. In the house consist of my female cousin, male cousin, aunt and uncle. Also my other aunt and uncle and my mom and dad. its a pretty full house, and my parents have been arguing every other night. My aunt called me tonight trying to keep the peace in the house and calm down both sides. My female cousin and her family has no idea this is going on. But most likely suspect something because of the arguing between my parents and im afraid they will find out whats going on soon enough, which will be really embarrassing. I feel like my mom and dad need marriage counseling, or my mom needs to see a therapist, but being asian they don't believe in these types of counseling classes and will be very hard to get my mom to agree to do something like this. --- **tl;dr**: What can I do to help out my family? I'm not trying to take sides but I really don't think my dad would ever cheat on my mom. Every time I try to talk some sense Into my mom, she always ends up getting mad, and saying everyone thinks I'm crazy but I'm not. They have been married for 30 years and my dad has always worked two jobs his entire life to make sure all the bills are paid, that we have food and shelter.

"Beautifully Broken Iâve spent most of my life afraid to be my true self because I believed that if I didnât live up to the standards and norms that I grew up with, I wouldnât be accepted. I was told since a young age how I should act, talk, and dress. I was told that money was important and that attending societal events and bullshit balls was your key to social success. And those things, trying to âfeelâ important, had meant everything to me. But then life screws you over and suddenly your perspective on everything changes. I learned that I no longer wanted to be the person that everyone said I had to be and things that had once seemed important became trivial. I realized that I didnât give a fuck if I had Tory Burch shoes or a Chanel bag. No amount of money could ever bring me happiness, which was clearly evident in the money that was spent on âIâm sorryâ shopping trips and my therapist. Things started falling apart at home when I was 15 years old. So my remedy to broken family was to drink until I couldnât feel. But despite my new fond love of alcohol and its pain killing effects, I kept my life together. I worked hard in school, I stayed active in my community, and I made sure people thought I was keeping it together. I couldnât let everyone know that I was a fucking mess. But in this process, I slowly lost myself and started living two different lives. When the curtains were wide open, people saw a girl that was very studious, had many accomplishmentâs, and always had a smile on her face. But as soon as the curtains closed and I was alone, my demons came out. And the more I hid, the more I lost myself. At one point, the alcohol wasnât enough. Things had only gotten worse at home and I needed a new escape. The first time I did it, it was a pair of scissors. It was small, barely noticeable. I had sworn after the first time that I would never hurt myself again. But eventually I did, and when I left for college it had only gotten worse. By my second year of college, I had reached my lowest point. I was in a toxic, emotionally abusive, relationship. I had a broken relationship with my parents, who spent most of their time stuck in a cycle of fighting, not speaking, and then pretending that they were okay. I hadnât spoken to my older brother, a struggling addict at the time, in almost a year. I no longer knew who I was. So one night I went out and bought a bottle of wine with my fake ID and went back to my apartment and chugged the entire thing. I sat on my bathroom floor crying, staring at the knife in my hand. And in the back of my mind I thought about the gun that was a few feet away from me hidden in a book that my dad had given me for protection. For the first time in my life, I had looked at mortality straight in the face. I had questioned it many times, but it was never like that night. Eventually the crying stopped and the numbness came, a feeling I had become all too familiar with. Would I do it? Could I do it? Would anyone care? I was consumed with darkness, but there was a small flicker of light, of hope. I wanted to help people, I wanted to one day to change the world, or at the very least change one personâs life. I wasnât ready to leave just yet, so I held on to the tiny amount of hope that was left in me. I called the cops and was admitted into a psychiatric center. I spent 48 hours in a white walled, emotionless, prison like place. And not once did someone ask me if I was okay. My parents came up to see me and had a difficult time accepting what had happened and I didnât understand why. They knew I wanted help, they saw the scars on my arms, and they knew that I wasnât okay. They blamed my relationship with my then boyfriend and told me to never speak of this to anyone. They didnât want people to know I was âcrazyâ. Was I? During that time, I came to believe I was, but now I understand that I was just broken. Itâs been over three years since that happened and although I still struggled with a lot after that, Iâm now in a better place. The reason I am writing this is because I promised myself to one day help the 15-year-old me whose cries for help where tossed to the side, who was told she was over-dramatic and crazy, and who thought that cutting was the only way to cope. There was a reason I grew up surrounded by mental illness. I watched not only myself go through it, but I saw my brother, my parents, my friends, and so many people on the news struggling with their own demons. And this didnât happen because life felt like fucking me over, it was just trying to show me what my reason for living is. I spent years ashamed of the person I was because I was scared to show people my true, raw, fucked up self. But isnât that the problem? When it comes to having a mental illness, we believe the stigmas that come attached to it and weâre afraid to speak up and talk about it. And the people who are lucky enough to not experience it, donât want to talk about it either. The only difference from how mental illness was treated a hundred years ago and now, is that we no longer hide and chain our family members in basements or attics,

"Awaiting the downward spiral. Had an awesome weekend with a whole bunch of friends from online who all came together, from all around Australia, for three days of drinking and festivities. Now I've travelled home and I'm all alone again. It's great that I have so many fantastic friends Online, but it's horrible we all live so far away. I'm already missing them terribly, and feeling down. I know that I'm about to spiral downwards even futher after having gotten drunk for three days. It's inevitable, but I'm trying to prepare. I'm going to try and draw, spend time with my Service Parrot and submerge myself in my gaming community. To keep myself as positively distracted as I can. I'm already trapped in an endless loop of thinking about my ex, who I still love and miss so much, and beating myself up. Searching for answers and ways how I could of been a better person for him. He told me he hated me and that I made him feel like a child. But i never intended for my help to make him feel like that. I tried to support and encourage him with everything. Emotionally and financially. I pushed myself to work 30+hrs a week when I was anxious and depressed because he became so closed off, so we had a roof over our head and food in our belly when we were made homeless. I tried to help him with being motivated to work, and to be able to support himself. I gave him every part of myself, because I loved him so much. And I keep holding on to things he said, before he forgot what this love really meant to him. And all the love that I gave to him, that never got into him. No matter how hard I tried. I wish he knew I don't hate him for what he said to me and that my suicide attempts weren't to make him feel guilty. I genuinely wanted to end my life. The thoughts of whatever I had done for him to hate me weighs so heavy upon me, that I fear to live with a guilt that was my own. I failed to be the person he wanted me to be, but worse; I failed to be the person I needed to be for him. Now we're 2000km apart and, Emotionally, I'm struggling to keep my head up. Financially, I know He's struggling too. Everyone keeps teling me I shouldn't care about him, but that just makes me hate myself more, that I do. I know I'm going to spiral further, it's inevitable, but I'm trying to prepare. *breathes* Edits: Grammr/Punctuation

Last year, my grandfather passed away and it was a sad time for the family. I was upset, but no where near what I think I should have been. I still have a hard time getting truly excited about things that should be fun, like going back to uni and seeing friends etc. It's hard feeling to describe. Dazed or aloof maybe?

"Unmotivated to be anymore Looking at my life from an objective point of view right now I have a lot of shit to do. I have no intentions on doing any of it though. Iâve stopped solely telling myself I want to die. I donât know if I want to die. I donât know if I want to be alive. I donât even really care. Iâm indifferent to both options. I feel like the only thing I do care about is what people think of meâwhich fuckin sucks not gonna lie. I take so much offense to someone not liking me in every way, yet Iâm too fucking unmotivated and indifferent to make myself better.

"I think you guys might understand this. I was walking with a close friend after having lunch together, and I told her, ""I feel as if I'm living on borrowed time."" She asked me to explain further, but I couldn't find the words to better express that perspective. She then proceeded to recount to me all of the myriad ways she's nearly died on some of the trips she's taken. I confessed that I couldn't really relate to those sorts of situations or how they've affected her, as she has more zeal for life than anyone I've ever met. Whatever she was describing about perceived proximity to death didn't suit me. Then the words came to me. I feel as if I'm living on borrowed time, because I feel like I could, at any moment, lose what little will to live I have left. It's like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop. I see it in slow-motion, slowly falling to the cold pavement, but I don't know when it will finally make contact. In the meantime, I'm existing, trying to experience new things and connect to people as much as I am able to, but I can't shake the conviction that I'll eventually resolve to leave by my own hand, despite whatever life I've made for myself. The fight's already been lost, and at some point, I'll have to accept defeat.

"I just found my half sister &amp; half brother &amp; I'm super excited &amp; a bit down at the same time I've known for many years about them, in fact my father (whom is their father as well, different mothers) was the one that told me I had a little sister, this was when I was around 10 yrs old or so. Since then I've chosen to put them in the back of my mind. My gf had asked me if I would ever look them up or would want to meet them, I just blahhed the question. So this past Sunday morning I typed in my last name on Facebook &amp; started snooping around. Voila, there was my half brother, voila, there was my half sister. No lie, I was extremely happy, &amp; extremely sad. My father had, has, is unfaithful to my mother. Because of that reason I had no interest in meeting my half family. Now I've run into my sister, she's 24 yrs old, super smart &amp; beautiful. I messaged her, we went back &amp; forth answering each other's questions. Now we are planning on meeting for the first time before she moves away across the country. It is a very God blessed situation that I am in. I always prayed to God that I would get a sister, (I am the eldest of three from both my dad &amp; mom, all three brothers) &amp; now God said, BAM, here you go. My sister seems like she is excited as well, I hope she is. Has anyone gone through something similar, have a similar life experience ?

"I am just confused what I should do or how I should act.(17M Asian)(Parent issues) My dad a man I dearly respect for his achievements and the hard work he does for my family, treats me like shit in comparison to my twin brother. Often seeing my dad trying to be cheerful when talking to my brother and transitioning to his normal angry and grumpy self towards me, I can't help to be jealous. In terms of general achievements my brother and I are leveled equally but my brother is self centered and like an ass hole to my dad. Remembering a event few days ago, my dad asked him to come to a restaurant with the family but refused to go, reasoning that he didn't believe in family ties and emotions, only to be found playing with his online buddies when walking in(this happens most week). Even then my dad tried his best to be cheerful towards him after dinner while I just got his tired grumpy looks. I am honestly thinking of just being a huge dick to my dad now and appeasing the retarded filial piety in my family. Any thoughts?

"Anyone ever look back at their younger years and wonder how they used to be such a joyful person? I saw a post on here about someone remembering a feeling of emptiness since they were five and just not knowing it was depression. For me it's the opposite. I was always a super joyful kid, and maybe a little too hyper. (I was that annoying kid when I was 10-11). Then around seventh grade I started to withdrawal from the world slightly, and just talked a little less than average. This seemed all fine at the time, it made me a more likable person. But I think that was the beginning. I finally realized my lack of a friend group because of how I acted when I was younger during third quarter that year. It wasn't bad depression, but it only got worse from there. My Dad turned from mean to abusive starting next year, and my mom started to be disappointed with everything I do. My parents don't even know anything about me besides a few keywords because they haven't held a conversation with me since I was 11. The only person who I can say genuinely cares for me is my best friend, and he doesn't even know I am depressed. I don't see a reason why I am, so why should I explain that to someone who is much more depressed than I am? By the time I turned 14 I can say I was depressed. ""Functionally depressed"" I guess, using terminology from one of the top posts here. I don't know what to do.

"Need advice on helping a friend escape an abusive dad A week ago, my best friend Jake (not his real name) confided in me that he has been physically and emotionally abused by his father since childhood. We are both 17 years old and we have been best friends for 4 years. I was really shocked when I found out because everyone in our high school friend circle sees him as extremely seemingly cheerful and upbeat. I'm his best friend, and I never suspected anything was wrong. This morning, he texted me saying that he was running away from home. He told me he left his home with a backpack full of clothes and $100 that he had secretly saved up without his dad's knowledge. I'm very worried about him. On the one hand, I think he should get out of that dangerous situation as soon as possible. On the other hand, I think it will be very difficult for him to survive on his own with so little money.

"What to do with my life. I just turned 21 in June and Iâm really understanding that life is moving at a very fast pace. I was never good in school only because I hated it and never realized how bad it would effect my future the way it is now. I moved away for college at 19 for a whole year and only passed a few classes because I didnât care that much. I came home and decided to take the year off. In that year off I didnât grow as a person and I feel empty all I do is sleep and play video games and go out once every two months to hangout. My parents are complaining that I have no girl friend , no life and Iâm anti social. Iâm not anti social I just feel so empty and lost that I donât feel like doing anything anymore. I donât even know if I can go back to school because of my grades were and I was lucky enough to get into school. I donât want to move out I just want to go to school and come home as quickly as I can no friends nothing. This lack of growth in the last year has made me thinking to the point. Do I kill myself? Whatâs the point of living if I donât finish school and get a job, why live if Iâm just gunna work min wage my whole life? Lately Iâve been asking myself this everyday. What do I do with my life? Is there really a point in living if I donât become a engineer, doctor, lawyer, etc ? All my friends are doing great but Iâm just at the bottom and I donât understand why they would hangout with a loser like me that isnât even at school In my early 20s and Iâm living at home. Iâve already missed out of going away for university. I really feel like killing my self is the last option I have because if not Iâll be homeless because I donât want to hurt my parents anymore with the embarrassment of a child I am and live at home.

"Having to share a small living space with Grandpa My grandpa and I are having trouble adjusting to our new living situation, and I was wondering if anyone had any ideas to help us in this predicament. Backstory: I never really saw eye to eye with him while growing up. He was quite the wild prankster, and his antics often left me humiliated and embarrassed. Back in my boyhood of 1991, he pantsed me while I performed at the school talent show. He routinely mentions this while at family gatherings, and it has subsequently caused me extreme grief. This trend of surprise humiliation lasted for two decades. Just when I thought me and gramps were cool again, I'd feel my pants hit the ground. He's deprived me of my sanity, as well as given me an extreme fear of public speaking scenarios. I ended up forcing him to go to family counseling with me, and he denied the whole thing. After turning in historical footage (my mom always cam-corded my recitals or graduation ceremonies), he finally gave in and admitted to his rude behavior. It took a couple dozen sessions, ending with a mock-talent-show, where I played my trumpet for the therapist. Gramps just sat there, cool as ice. With arms folded, he nodded to me - and that's where things changed. Anyhow, I had an extra ticket to go see Teagan and Sara - so I got ol' gramps on the phone. He kinda razzed me for listening to such feminine sounding music, but eventually accepted my invitation. I picked him up and brought him to the venue. The ticket office said there was a mixup, and that we'd get front-row seats. This was my lucky day, as well as a great way to finally bond with the old codger. It took a couple of songs, but he really got into it. He was so exuberant, jumping up and down on his seat. He pulled me up, and I did the same. After the first half of the set wrapped up, the sisters on stage looked down at gramps and I. They asked us if we were having a good time, and also the nature of our relation. A stage hand passed down a microphone to gramps. ""I'm here with my grandson!"" There was this big 'awwww' that came from the crowd. They asked us how long he'd been a fan, and he mentioned the fact that I would sometimes play their songs on my trumpet. To my amazement, they pulled me and gramps on stage for the next song. They got me a trumpet and instructed me to play a solo to ""I was a fool"" - It was literally one of the best moments of my life. I was on stage with my favorite sister duet band. Right as I put the brass mouthpiece to my lips, I felt those wrinkly little fingers jutting into my belt loops. I tried to stop him, but my pants hit the ground before I could react. I wanted to die in that moment. Security ended up escorting us out of the venue, where a police officer was waiting for us. Now we're both cell mates for the next year. We got caught in some type of legal double-whammy. He, being the pantser, was ruled guilty for sexual assault. Me, the pants-ee, was convicted of exposure and indecency. Both of us will have to register as sex offenders once we're out of the clink. Anyhow - I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on how we could pass the time together? Any board games or things like that? We have a whole year of time to kill, and it really took being cellmates for me to understand exactly how generation gapped we are. Anyhow, your advice is greatly appreciated. I gotta hide this phone, but I'll check for your replies later tonight. Thanks!

"I find myself searching suicide methods. I can't seem to bring myself to actually end it. Though I love fantasizing about killing myself, from sitting in my car with the garage closed to overdosing on heroin. I hate my life I am a failure I haven't accomplished any goal of mine ever, I've lost all of my friends, and I spend all day everyday on my bed. I want this shit to end but I'm to much of a bitch to kill myself or get off my ass and fix my life.

"Please someone read this, i've been holding so well since my dad died but now... I feel like killing myself is sooner or later inevitable. I came back home from my boyfriend's house because I think I should spend some time with my mom. My dad's death made me speak what I feel and even stopped suicidal thoughts. But today.... I decided to be honest about few things unregarded to my dad. Now mind you, me and my mom has always had rocky relationship and I would never tell her much. Now I reminded myself why... Since my dad died I've been honest to her about my limits towards me seeing his corps the day before burial and I've been crystal clear that this Saturday I didn't feel ready yet to go to the cemetery and I assured her that I'll surely go one day. An hour ago she told me that me telling her all of that is avoiding all those responsibilities. I'm shocked, I feel hurt, I feel anger and... Hatred... One of my coworkers told me ""don't do anything you have no strength for, don't push yourself, everyone grieves differently"". She's the only person that understands me... I will talk to her tomorrow because she will understand. She's such a kind person... But not... I feel so weak and I feel like sooner or later I will kill myself because that's too much, I have no one to realistically help me besides good words. I feel like now there's nothing that will hold me. At least i want to be understood by someone. I won't get it from mom, I feel like I won't get it from boyfriend. Im too tired, I really am. Please someone believe me. I have no where to go, nowhere! Please.

""Castle on the hill"" got me messed up Don't know why the song suddenly got to me, I've heard and seen it before but now it makes me so sad. I never had that, I don't have friends I could go to, get back to, I just have nobody. After half of my life I wouldn't say I'm depressed anymore, but now I have to deal with the fallout of years and years and years of digging myself in a hole, I have to start everything over. I have no foundation to build on. I feel sad, maybe a little fearful that I will never manage to achieve that genuine bonding and feeling of belonging I could have gotten in my teens. I'm proud I'm still here, I'm proud I've come so far, but right now I'm incredibly disheartened and I don't know how to process this sadness. Edit: everything seems suddenly so meaningless and fake

"For those on antidepressants, is it working? Alternatives to antidepressants? Okay so Iâm going back to a psychiatrist next week for my depression. Iâve been going since high school and over the years have had depressive thoughts, suicidal ideation, lack of motivation and interest, high anxiety, numbness, hopelessness, etc etc. recently itâs been coming back. Iâve been on Zoloft which made me feel like a numb zombie and bupropion which I didnât feel was working. Iâve also tried Xanax (made me calmer but high) and a mood stabilizer that didnât really help. Iâve since gotten off medication by my own choice but the problems are coming back. Generally I donât like rx drugs and would rather do it naturally but itâs not going away. My question to people is what antidepressants have worked, how long have u been using them, and has ur depression improved? Should I take it for the long term? And what alternative methods have worked for you guys?

"Consistent problems with friends distancing themselves Really sorry in advance of how long this is! So some background on me: Iâm a 23 year old female. Had a pretty typical life growing up. Had a really stereotypical family - mom, dad, sister, and me. Had good friends growing up, moved schools as a kid only once, and had stuff I was passionate about. During my sophomore year of high school though, my parents got divorced, and shortly after, I had some events happen in my life that sent me into a deep depression. I became suicidal. Now mind you, up through this point, I have had a close knit group of about 8 of us. One girl and I had been friends for almost 7 years and generally I got along with pretty much anyone. Then this guy I knew from performing arts stuff and I ended up going into a relationship. He was 4 years older than me, meaning he was in college when we started dating, I had barely turned 16 and never had been in a serious relationship, he was charming and wanted me to ânot be so naiveâ and - if you canât already see the warning signs - this became an extremely abusive relationship, in pretty much every way possible starting with emotional abusive, escalating to physical abuse, and eventually sexual abuse. It completely destroyed me as a person. He forced me to end friendships with anyone who tried to help get away from him, which ended up being all of my friends. Eventually, my college roommate helped me escape from him and helped me to get a restraining order during my Freshman year of college. Thankfully, Iâm in a really wonderful relationship with someone incredibly kind and supportive and have been for nearly 5 years. But with the exception of my boyfriend now, I havenât been able to connect with people like I used to before that abusive relationship. Some friends I had back then, friends I loved dearly, never forgave me for ending the friendship, despite the fact I never wanted to. And it still really hurts. I mostly have had off and on friendships through recent years. Mostly the story is: I start talking to a potential friend, we quickly find a bunch of similarities and similar humor, become close really quickly, they become avoidant/ distant/ flakey (or in a recent case - manipulative) and I get upset and end the friendship. Iâm quick to forgive and a HUGE pushover, and people really take advantage of this and at some point, I realize this and thatâs when I get upset. The other story is that I start to slowly build friendships, like with people at work, and I think things are going well and I come to realize they donât really care to be anything more than work friends or they donât like me as much as I thought they did. I currently have 2 friends that I really care about. One of them lives really far and I only get to see occasionally. The other has started to use the busy excuse with me, but then she plasters her hanging out with everyone but me on social media, but the goes on about how she misses me so much and wishes we could hang out. She literally only lives 20 minutes away and she either flakes or lies about being busy working. Itâs starting to really bring me down and I feel really down about it since I feel like itâs something that ultimately ends up happening no matter how hard I try or how good of friends we are. To sum everything up, I feel like Iâm at a loss and I have a hard time connecting with anyone. I feel like people go out of their way to distance themselves from me when I want to actually do ~friend stuff~ like hang out. I feel like Iâm missing something.

"How can I tell me friend that I don't want to babysit his (difficult) kid? I want to be a good friend, and there for him in case of emergencies. I've picked up his kid from daycare before when his babysitter called out on him. But then he asked me to babysit and the hours ended up being 8AM to 7PM(!). He asked me two weeks ago if I could babysit on February 3rd, and I told him I couldn't make a commitment so far in advance. (Knowing he'd have plenty of time to find a sitter). This is clearly not an emergency, and he's about to ask me again (it's a week away). I know I shouldn't have led him on at all; that it's better to be direct. But dear god, I cannot come up with the words to tell him I would rather die than spend any more time alone with his son. Last time I saw his kid, he literally threw a toy car at my face and it hit me in the mouth. He's incredibly defiant and screams bloody murder all day. He refuses to hold my hand if I take him out of the house to the park and screams and screams and I just hate that kidd!!!!!!! I know I can't tell him how much I dislike being around his kid, and I don't want to end up hinting at this. Any suggestions on a response text? I don't want to have to keep telling him I have plans. I want him to stop asking.

"Reddit, need your help on restoring friendship Hello there, dear redditors. I truly need your advice and every opinion is highly appreciated, so feel free to express whatever's on your mind. I'll try to keep things as short as possible, so here's the problem. I know a friend of mine since we were 7 and now i'm 23. Recently (for a month or two) i started allowing new people in my life, which is pretty unusual for me and it got so overwhelming and intense that i didn't notice i started building distance with my best friend because i concentrated on new people too much. Eventually we got so far from each other that we barely even talk. We still respect each other and are chatting on occasion trying to look like we're still those ""good old friends"", but i can tell that he's not okay with the situation, even despite he's trying not to show me that. I know i fucked up big time. He's my best friend that has always been there for me and i won't forgive myself if i'll lose him. So, reddit, what do i do? I know it would be the best just to tell about the situation, but i can't find proper words and it pains me. Thanks in advance.

"How to ask someone to move out. TL:DR Friend has overstayed their welcome, how to politely ask her to leave? 4 months ago, my friend was going through a rough time. She had split up with her partner and was struggling to find somewhere to live. My fiance and I own our home and had a spare room so offered her to stay, till her work contract was up in February, for a very very low rent (it's a quarter of what people pay in our area). So now we're in february she has a renewed contract at work and isn't looking at places to live. Little things she does around the house bug me, but thats probably just because its our home and not a shared rental. However recently I've suffered a string of ill health (multiple hospital admissions) and now i'm home I just want my own space! She has cut her work hours to look for a new job but barely looks and just sits around the house. I feel like i'm cleaning up after her all the time, plus she is always eating our food. At the moment I am struggling to keep on top of my own mess let alone hers. How can I go about asking her to move out without losing the friendship?

"Communicating is hard I'm turning 19 this year and I want to move out of my family's house in September. Mostly for my studies, but also because I simply want to move out. I already tried last year but they found a housing for young girls managed by nuns, so I lived here for a while, but I felt uneasy the whole time. I'm heavily depressed and I had to drop out of school this year. My parents told me to come back home so that I could recover, which I did, but they don't approve of me going anywhere else to do so. For example, I feel really good in my boyfriend's family (he doesn't live with them anymore but I'm still very close to them) and wish to spend more time there, but my parents don't like the idea of not being able to give me the kind of comfort I need and find over there, so they'd rather have me stay home. I have spent as little time as possible in my parents' house recently, using every opportunity to get away, and it is understandable they don't like it. But I have always been a solitary kid, and now with my depression it became worse. I don't connect with my parents or any of my 4 siblings, and spending time with them feels like a chore. Communicating within the family is quite rough. And whenever I do try to explain how I feel, it becomes overwhelmingly clear that I'm in the wrong. It feels like whatever I say about feeling bad within the family is deflected by stating my parents and siblings' good intents. I'm sure they do mean well, but I now doubt even my own reasons for wanting anything but staying with them. I can't identify the reason why I don't feel easy with them, because they're all trying their best to help me through those tough times. I feel like an ungrateful brat. I'm not really confrontational either. I usually obey and agree to avoid stirring conflict, but this is getting tiring. If any of you has been in a similar situation, how can you open the dialogue? How can I tell my parents I don't feel good spending much time with them? In my family, direct family should come before everything. I also don't know how to talk about moving out and have a studio instead of being placed in a student housing, especially since my big sister (25) still lives at home despite having a job. It's not a matter of money either. I come from a middle class family and the housing my parent chose for me this year is much more expensive than a studio. Any advice would be welcomed.

"How do you tell your kids to handle weird adults? When I was 14, my best friend's mom started accusing me of smoking. I'd been best friends with her daughter since we were in 1st grade and I was over their house all the time. But for some reason when I was 14, she started asking. And she very low key but repeatedly accused me of smoking for about 2 more years. I had always been a straight A kid, top of my class, and a ""good"" kid. I had tried one cigarette when I was 13, had HATED it, and never tried another. I wasn't around anyone who smoked, no friends, no peers, no family members (immediate or extended) smoked, so there's no chance I smelled like smoke. But friend's mom persisted, and told me that she thought that I smoked because she found cigarette butts at the end of their driveway. Because obviously that couldn't have been from anyone else right? Now in hindsight, her behavior was absolutely bizarre. As a teen, I accepted it as, she's an adult, and while I questioned her and vigorously fought back whenever she'd say something, it never occurred to me to get a sane adult involved. I'm hoping to install in my kid that they should tell me stuff like that if it ever happens. While nothing truly bad happened in my case, the lady was off her rocker, and I'm lucky nothing else happened. How did people with older kids do that? Like I know my parents gave me the ""if people are making you uncomfortable, talk to us"" speech but this never made me upset, I just got angry and baffled at first, but then it kind of became this joke among all our friends and we just laughed at her. In hindsight, this could have ended very poorly for me had the mom escalated.

"Whatâs the worst thing a friend has ever said to you? I have two stories. 1. This was a few years ago. It was near Christmas time. I had gotten my friend a $300 iPod. I was planning on giving it to her the week before Christmas. So a week prior to me giving her the present, I take her to the movies. I worked at the movie theater so the ticket was free. But I got her a few pins we sell, we got a photo at the photo booth, and we got concessions. The total was probably around $50. When I got to paying for the popcorn and candy, my coworker said it was nice of me to pay for all of it. I jokingly said âthis is her Christmas present.â My friend said that it was the cheapest present. Should have taken the iPod back after that, just to be petty. But she had been in a serious car accident that year so I reconsidered that. 2. This one was recent. We live in different countries. She texted me, after not speaking for three days due to busy schedules, about how Iâm lucky to not have a health issue. I thought she was just upset with her life. But she was evidently mad at me. She made it seem like I donât deserve my Masters degree because I didnât work as hard for mine since I didnât have to overcome any health issues. The worst thing she said was that I keep bragging about my life, but ânobody cares about you.â She tried apologizing maybe five minutes later but I ignored it. She somehow assumed I wouldnât be angry. After many texts, I told her that I was upset and that I needed space. She got upset that I was upset about what she said. Just because you are sick and your life feels like shit, that doesnât give you the right to say something like that to someone and still expect to be friends. Two weeks later she told me how my happy posts were annoying her and she hated it. Blocked her without replying. Sometimes we need to let things go. The people who are your friends will never say stuff like this.

"I didn't want have to post this, but I have to get it off my chest (I don't expect to get sympathy from this, but closure) I have a cousin, who i've known for 13 years, and over time... He became more and more distant, he got friends, most of them were verbally abusing me, you would think he would defend me, but he backed up his friends, than his own blood, me growing up, I was (and still to this day) an introvert, and I never kept a close friend, because they would either stop talking to me, or they would say that they don't like me and for the 3 years that I have known his friends, they eventually got used to me, and we played online frequently, and 2 months ago, they disapproved of me getting a GTA Shark Card (in game currency) then they insult me saying I need to grow up, and mature, basically telling me how to run my life, and I tried to stand up for myself, but they still kept saying it Its my life, if I want to act silly, then I will, but the main focus is my cousin, and how he was brutally honest, you know how we hype up our friend to make them feel good about himself/herself? That's not what he did, every time we play online with one of his friends, he would agree and add insult to injury when his friend makes fun of me, in games... He would tell everyone to go after me, in CoD, he would tell everyone to go to his lobby because he's the ""leader"" but the sole reason I'm making this post, was the fact that he did one of, if not, the RUDEST thing ever, here's how it went it was my sister's birthday, I was texting, and he said that he's coming to the party, and I'm pretty happy, a smile stretches around my face, I say ""OK cool, :)"" an hour passes by, and he nonchalantly says, ""welp sorry I can't come, oh well"" and I ask why? And he says I don't know, now usually, most would tell the reason why can't come, or if they don't they make up something, but he all of a sudden says, I can't come I want you keep in mind that, the last time I was in his house, was 4 years ago, and he has only came over for my birthdays or sometime in the fall, so he RARELY comes to my house, and I'm not even allowed back at his house, because of personal reasons but anyway, he couldn't come to my house, but has time to go to his friends house WHENEVER he wants... Gee? I wonder why? -_- he did what no other friend should have done, and hurt my feelings all in one fell swoop. I'm done with him, but if he asks for forgiveness, should I ignore him, accept his apology? I'm not expecting an answer but whatever....

"Depressed? Or Just in a Bad Rut? (Long Post) I've never really felt like I've had depression before. I'm turning 24 at the end of the week, and this is the first time I've honestly wondered about myself. Usually, I'm pretty happy about things, and my outlook on life has always been realistically positive. But, lately, I just feel absolutely lost. And this morning, after I got off of work, I sat and cried. I'm not much of crier at all, and the only other time I've cried in the last ten years has been at an uncle's funeral recently. This past summer, for me, was a pretty great time. I was in a relationship with a girl who really made me happy, more than any other one had before. I seemed to be having fun every weekend, whether with her or with some friends of mine or family. I had a lot on the horizon, and a lot to look forward to. I was getting ready to finish up my degree, and it seemed like things were going in the right direction. The only thing that was a problem then was that my job was a third shift job, but it was 3 days a week, and usually 11-13 hour shifts, meaning I had time to do stuff outside of it. But, my then girlfriend and another friend had solid connections that they thought could help me land a much better job where they worked, which would carry me pretty well until I finished school. Things were looking up for me. I was pretty happy. I guess things started to slip for me when my uncle got hit with a terminal diagnosis in August. At 47, and with young children, nobody in the family was prepared to lose him. And the disease, an incredibly rare degenerative brain disease, was the same one that killed my grandmother 11 years ago. We lost him in early September. The thing with this disease that nobody in the family is talking about is that, if it hits twice within the same bloodline, there's a 50% chance that living relatives within the bloodline will get it in their 40's or 50's. There's nine of us left in the immediate family, including my mother, my brother and myself. And since it's so rare, there is absolutely no treatment plan. That, for me, was a lot to process. I'm not worried about myself, but the idea that I could still be losing relatives to this disease for years sucks. It's hard enough seeing it happen twice. During this time, things started to fall apart with me and my then-girlfriend as well. I kind of hid out with her for a while, because my family was perpetually sad and in a state of distress. And since I worked nights, I was kind of isolated. Things started to hit a rut between me and her when she started her own treatment for depression. I tried to be supportive of her, while doing whatever anyone in my family needed while my uncle was sick. She really seemed happy that I was there for her, (and things really worked out since she lived so close to my uncle anyways, and I could bounce back and forth from place to place on my days off.) Both my family and my girlfriend were very important to me, and I guess helping them out made me feel good about myself, even though the situation was shitty. I kind of let school fall to the back-burner though. And I kind of neglected my other friends for a while as well. But between work, my family, and her, I was consistently busy. My uncle passed in early September, sending most of my family into a pretty bad state, and only a week later, my girlfriend decided she was done with me, because she was afraid that if she recovered from her depression with me around, then she'd equate me with happiness, and if I left her then she wouldn't be able to recover. (Which ended up being mostly a made up way of saying, I don't love you anymore, but I don't have the courage to tell you.) Obviously, it wasn't fair to her to be stuck with me if she wasn't happy with me, but there were so many better opportunities for her to break things off, and she chose the one that was the most tedious and mentally draining for me. My state of mind after it ended wasn't great at all, and I said some very mean things to her after it ended, (I guess, at the time, I thought it was constructive criticism, but it was all just mean and awful and embarrassing.) Understandably, she hasn't talked to me since, and I feel like I burned any bridge towards reconciling with her. I missed my uncle a lot, but doing favors for his wife and kids helped me at least feel like I was contributing. My mother's still kind of a mess about it, but she has my father for support. My brother had a hard time for a while too, but his job keeps him well occupied. But, lately, for me, the things I can help with anymore have been fewer and fewer. Right now, I just want to fast forward to like March or April. I don't want to deal with my birthday, since the plans I had with my ex-girlfriend are obviously not happening anymore, most of my friends are busy with work and school, and my family is still not back to being normal. Nobody seems to want to do much for my birthday anyways, which is, for lack of a better word, normal for me. When I got home from work this morning, I cried thinking about it all. I've never had that kind of emotional reaction to anything before. The only thing I look forward to in life at the

"Trying to help family of friend who committed suicide, any ideas? My friend took his life almost a year ago and his family (wife and three daughters aged 10, 14 and 18) is still reeling. None of them are getting the emotional support they need. His wife doesn't regularly see her therapist, she stays out all night several times a week with her new boyfriend, the 18 year old has suicidal thoughts, the 14 year old just feels hated by mom and, along with the 10 year old, is not getting therapy. The 18 year old is getting therapy but she's hardcore into her new religious affiliation, hating mom and can't wait to leave for college I've talked to the wife several times and shared my thoughts about what's going on, she's receptive when I when I speak to her, but it's apparent after this amount of time that she has no real intention of going through with getting the kids counseling and getting into family therapy, staying home more, spending more time with the kids, less time with the husband, etc. Does anyone have any idea how I can help? If I keep telling her what she's not doing well, I'm afraid she's going to shut me out and then I won't be able to do anything. If this isn't a good sub for this kind of thing and you have an idea what might be, please let me know. Edit--I live in NYC, they are outside of Dallas, TX, so seeing them isn't much of an option. Also, the wife has been cut off from her deceased husband's family due to some of her behavior, and doesn't have any support from her side of the family led by her mentally ill mother. Thank you.

"I feel trapped in a life I don't want to live. It took a lot of time for me to consider posting here but I'm gonna be alone for the whole day and can't deal with it. So, hi, I'm just your typical British kid dealing with the stresses of College but the problem is that I'm not stressed because of college (I don't really care much for it but it's better then work), I'm stressed because of this constant cycle of: wake up, spend an hour trying to get up, be 20 minutes late to everything every day, eat, browse the Internet and sleep. All around me there's people who have clear career paths and know what they're passionate about, but I look at myself and realise that I don't have that. I have no interest in working in a job for the next 45 years of my life because there's nothing that I'd like doing. I'm doing fine in all of my classes (As in History and Cs in Maths, Distinctions in BTEC Engineering, everything just feels too simple) but I just still get these weeks where I feel worthless and pointless. I get brain fog, I end up teary eyed and can't talk to anybody for fear of looking stupid (I have speech problems). But then when I end up actually talking to others I apparently look happy. I have spoken to people at my school about it, but it's the same thing every time. 'Oh you're struggling? We'll have a five minute conversation about your feelings and wait months to make sure you're not still sad'. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety but I stopped taking medication in July 2017 and haven't seen a doctor or therapist since. They didn't help, the medication I was on turned me into a god damn zombie and my therapist got exceptionally pissy at me for not telling the truth about my lack of improvement. I felt like I had to lie so I didn't waste their time and mine, I worry that's why I end up wearing a mask 90% of the time. Even around my family, who believe more in self-help then actually getting an actually decent therapist to try and help me. I'm ashamed to talk to them about it, no matter what anyone says, trust me when I say that they will NOT understand. I have been incredibly clear about it all and got mocked for it, some people just don't want to learn. I had a pretty bad childhood that I try to justify my problems with (dealt with a lot of sexual abuse and my mother died in 2013) but when I'm having these 'days' I'm not thinking about anything in particular that would make me flighty. I ended up admitting a lot of my past to one teacher last week who I admire greatly and whom pretty much just saved my life and I am still cringing today. I know I have no reason to cringe either, I just get so nervous of social interaction. I just don't get why the universe picked me to be its miserable little experiment. I never asked for anything bad to happen, I never asked to constantly feel tired and under the weather, I know that life isn't gonna be perfect but why is it that day after dull ass day I have to feel worse and worse? I try to take responsibility for my health, I feel like dirt, I have other people have some part in it and they take it for granted and hardly any of them actually make a big effort on me. Sorry if my words are jumbled and rambled, I just needed a place to vent whilst I still can.

"What would you do? What do you do when your depressions effects you so much to the point you don't eat or you over eat, you don't sleep or you over sleep, you don't talk to anyone or pretend to want to be around people. What do you do when your depression doesn't allow you to be motivated and takes away all the enjoyment from your life that makes you happy, removing music, dancing and laughing in replace for dark rooms, teary eyes, and silence. What do you do when you won't answer your phone being that only the bill collector is calling, cause you're not able to pay the credit thats pilling up that helps you survive, being that you can't work or can't make money cause of no interest too cause of lack of motivation, cause the thoughts running through your head being that you can't talk to anyone, or that you won't, or that you're disappointed, or that you feel like a burden. Now your phones off and there's no call but the collector is there, no text this shit isn't fair, so what's next? Social media? You can make it or it can break you, driving you to want to do the very thing you try not to think of day by day because you don't know what to do. What would you do?

"I am okay, until I have to be alone with my thoughts. I enjoy the company of my friends, even though I'm very bad at talking to them. When I'm out with them or rehearsing with my band I feel okay. I almost feel depression free for the time beingâ I feel like everything will be okay, that I got this, that I am in control, that it doesn't matter that I have a lot of homework due in the next week cause I'll go home and get it done. I feel strong and motivated. And then I have to go home. I am no longer in the company of people who love me, so I start feeling anxious. I start believing they actually fucking hate me. I lose it. I hate being alone because my horrible thoughts are a lot easier to hear over the silence of no one talking.

"girl So in the past 2-3 months i been talking to this one girl. I love everything about her and we really clicked together, seeing as we're both socially retarded. Literally everything's been looking up, i started working out, being generally happier and more carefree even in social environments. I'm not exactly depressed, just don't really feel much emotion and I don't relate to people around me. Never been a fan of going out and I've had major problems getting to know anyone (I only have 1 very close friend, besides her). I've always had the feeling that I'm tolerated but not wanted whenever I'm around others, but this chick changed that completely. I actually started to look forward to waking up in the morning and meeting her at uni. On a side note we also like pretty much the same things - similiar music taste, similiar views, similiar feeling of being a reject and ofc vidya games, books and other shit. I knew I was steadily falling in love with her (something I honestly thought impossible before) and just recently I found out she's got a boyfriend. I proceeded to spend the next 2 hours crying like a little bitch for the first time in over a decade. After that I couldn't even hit any fucking awp shots in cs cause I still had tears streaming from my eyes. My question is, have I reached the point of being pathetic enough that I should call it quits and neck myself?

"New friend always drags along insufferable friend. I've recently become chummy with a guy who I get along with swimmingly. Conversation is easy and stimulating, and we've reached the point in our friendship that we can talk about some really deep and personal stuff. Even more recently, however, he has gotten in the habit of inviting along another friend, Tony, to our friend dates. I'm not such a fan of Tony. He is negative and annoying, and genuinely makes the time we spend together unpleasant. How do I tell my friend that I don't want to hang out with Tony without coming across as a dick? Is there ever a point when I am candid about the reasons why?

"Getting over a girl Hello everyone, Iâve been subscribed to this sub for a while now but always been a lurker and never posted anything. I feel that this is the best place to get advice and help for what Iâm going through right now... So Iâm a 19 year old guy, Iâve never had a serious relationship with a girl before. I met this girl a few weeks ago and I instantly liked her. Sheâs the most amazing girl Iâve ever met. Sheâs funny, smart and so beautiful. We started texting/snapchatting. I told her I liked her and she said she felt the same about me. We started âtalkingâ and we met a few times and things were going really well. Last weekend she stopped over at my house and we watched some Netflix and had such a good night with each other. I knew I was in love with this girl and I could honestly see us getting in a relationship in the future. After she left my house the following morning she started acting weird. I asked her what was wrong and she said her ex boyfriend was going crazy because she stayed over at my house. She then said she just needed to be alone for a while and that we should stop seeing each other because she still hasnât properly got over her ex. It was so horrible, I started crying for ages and I couldnât stop. I still feel so upset about it and I donât think Iâll ever be able to get over her. How can I get over her? I canât stop reading our texts messaging of us saying we love each other. This is so hard. Iâm crying again.

"Whats the point anymore with love After nearly a year of struggling to stay happy from what happened between my ex and I and trying not to do relationships anymore, i let myself slip and gave myself a chance with this one girl who is amazing and nice and kind and such just to be thrown away after one fucken week. We work together and she liked me alot but since im a manager and shes an employee, we had to keep it a secret but people were already starting to spread rumors about us and my GM who wasntnearly as suspicious about it cut her hours and days for this week and i asked why. His response was that she was flirting with alot of other guys and it was becoming a problem so he cut her days to just 1 this week. When she saw the schedule she thought about us and how it was a bad idea to date and it wouldnt be a good idea anymore since she doesnt want to lose her job. Exactly one week of dating and I already lost someone that i didnt want to go away just like that. Like yeah im a bit sad but not enough to cry or anything but it just like, i was so fucken happy again i started to smile, something i havent done in months and it just felt nice but now im back to my depressed state of being lonely as usual and just play games, work and goto sleep and repeat that day after day until i end it all. This is why i try my best not to date or get attached to anyone because if i try to date, it will just end badly for me. I just want to be happy and have someone close.

"I need to sell/get rid of my gun I am realizing that the only reason I haven't killed myself is because my dog loves me. My first marriage ended over 7 years ago because my wife choose someone else over me. My fiance can create her own schedule, and she chooses to go in late so that she comes home after I go to sleep. My friends are having kids and families, and I have my little dog Dixie. She's amazing. I helped rescue her after her owner passed away and I could never do that to her again. She's 11 now and loves me. I read a story online about a dog passing away and I thought ""if little Dixie goes, I'll go too."" And it took hours before I realized that I don't think I'm kidding. I work only so that bills get paid. I'll never pay off my student loan debt. If I go soon, my nephew won't have any memories of me. I'm crying on my couch.

"How do I get my Best Friend back.. Last year me and one of my Best friend decided to get into a relationship.. it lasted a couple of months and she got disturbed due to some personal problems and i made a mistake of not giving her space as obviously I was worried as a boyfriend and also the best friend because she won't share what happened to her and truly it was something bad.. We both had an amazing Friendship of 6 years before that and there may not have been a single day that went by without talking to each other.. its like she became an integral part of my life.. But after she started to distance herself from the relationship I did keep bothering her which was a mistake on my part and I did apologize to her for that.. she kept blocking and unblocking me since then and I tried my best to get back our friendship as it matters to me more than a relationship as out of the few people who truly know me and are as important as the organs of my body she is one of them.. and as we know even without one organ a person feels Handicapped as I do now... Yes it might be selfish of me as I am the only one who wants the friendship to be like before.. all of my attempts have failed so far.. but its next to impossible to not think of her as she was my routine for past 6 years.. and I too tried the regular methods suggested everywhere like cutting contact, getting busy, etc but at the end of the day you always have some time for yourself and in that time her thoughts always come to my mind...

"I have a close friend who is problematic, but not towards me A couple of years ago, I had a falling out with one of my friends and during this time, I fell back on this girl in my class, who I will call Blue. We got close in only a few months, and eventually, this will be the only time we will ever be in the same class. It was just the two of us. I'm in one of her classes now and my friends still associate me as her best or one of her closest friends. It's not a particularly good association (doesn't reflect on me though, just her). A lot of people don't like her, especially the people I'm friends with now. I haven't been around for a while (I moved down to Brighton for a bit of time) and I haven't seen her either, but I know that she doesn't have a lot of friends. I've been hearing stories and past anecdotes about her that really troubled me, so I'd like to have some advice. This one girl (who would never lie about something like this because she's so sweet, probably still hasn't gone through puberty) said that Blue once pit her up against the teachers and made her cry because she was so stressed and she didn't understand the situation. Blue has a kind of controlling personality and will not be open-minded to other people's ideas and input. An idea of close friend of my close friend, Yellow, was swept by as Blue simply dismissed it, and just wrote what she wanted to do in a group project. Yellow is also quiet, VERY passive and formerly a good friend of Blue and to some point, even I, so when I heard this happening to Yellow, I was really shocked that Blue could even do something like that. She will also guilt-trip you and self-deprecate herself. She will tell you that everyone hates her and that she's really bad at a subject she does really well in. It's annoying, and sometimes I even hear it, but to others she does it in this really soft, guilt-tripping voice. It's a problem because often, she's the problem and then she guilt-trips to turn it to look like she's saying that the people calling her out are just trying to make her feel bad. But Blue has never done any of this to me. When I'm around her, we talk about our futures and Star Wars. She jokes and memes a lot, but because we're not as close anymore, they aren't as funny. I avoid confrontation too so I almost never rebutt her points. Recently, she apologized to me about how poor her behaviour was back then, but I didn't understand what she was talking about. Now, I get it. But her behaviour wasn't just 'back then' either, it was also just a couple (maybe about two) years ago. Maybe even now, but everyone has probably already distanced themselves from her. She also has this fake 'caring' voice that she uses around the people in her music group. She never uses this voice around me, but the music people all generally speak like that. The thing is, the 'caring' side to her is just like a mask, and the people who know her know that she's not usually like that. She has hurt their friends who don't deserve to be hurt, and for no apparent reason either. I know that most of my friends feel uncomfortable bringing her up around me because it'll be something negative (I've never heard anyone who really knows her say something positive about her), but because of that I've been sheltered to how she treats her classmates. Another girl (Red) once said that while she was consoling a friend who didn't like to be touched, Blue came in, wrapped her arms around the sobbing girl and 'glared' at Red like one of those mean girls. Never have I ever heard something so cliched and dramatised, but unfortunately, I could definitely picture it. When I'm around her, I definitely don't feel like her personality is weighing down on me, but I'm conscious of the connotations surrounding her. All the girls mentioned are also my friendly mutuals, so they don't associate me with her, as I'm generally polite, quiet and will crack a joke around them. I also know that Blue doesn't like people so when we were walking from our class, I'm worried that we'll bump into someone that doesn't like her or whom she doesn't like. So yes, I am very bothered about how people view her, mostly because there actually is something to dislike. What should I do? Slowly back out of this friendship? Should I slowly doorslam her until the end of the year when our class is over? Should I just continue being her friend despite her bad behaviours? Two things: the stories are most definitely true, and I don't want Blue to know that I know about her being a bad classmate. I overheard these stories from reliable people. Sorry for the long post. Please help.

"My SO has panic disorder and itâs making me depressed. My SO has been diagnosed for now with panic disorder (waiting on health monitor results to check to see if itâs not something else) The last couple of months have been really hard. He has overtime gotten more worried about his health and every time is convinced that itâs cancer or something else deadly. He can spend hours on google about a discomfort he feels and freaks out because webmd says it one thing and another site says something else. He checks his heart rate every 15 minutes because he downloaded an app on his phone. I have taken him to the er multiple times in the past couple of months and each time they say thatâs nothing is wrong heâs just having bad panic attacks. He wonât believe them because then heâll go on reddit and see stories of people being misdiagnosed. Iâm convinced heâs a hypochondriac. We canât go about one day without him saying he doesnât feel good. Itâs hard to enjoy myself whenever we go out because Iâm just waiting for him to say something about not feeling good so we can just leave wherever weâre at. I donât know how to fully support him through this. When he freaks out and wants to call the ambulance I donât know if I should let him knowing that theyâre just gonna say heâs fine or tell him that itâs in his head and make him feel like Iâm not taking him seriously. I feel bad for feeling this way. But itâs making me depressed. I donât know how to go about this.

"An Open Letter Dear you, It's been three years since we decided to go our separate ways. We both had different goals, desires and aspirations. We were perfect together, but just at the wrong time. I'm sorry things ended badly. I'm sorry that for months after they spiraled out of control. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I let you down, your family down. I'm sorry I buckled. I'm sorry I didn't have the experience or the know-how to react to certain situations. I'm sorry that I made mountains out of molehills. I'm sorry at times I treated you badly, that at times I held you back. Three years later, we live totally different lives than back then. I got that job. I traveled the world. I went to Italy - twice. I've been to Times Square at midnight, and so have you. I did it all, but by myself. It's not what I wanted. It's not what I envisioned. You can't just replace somebody special with another person, and that you were. Special. It's been three years. Despite some triumphs and successes, it still feels like I lost a war. An immense failure that didn't personify my persona, it personified myself. On the surface, I'm told I seem ambitious, fully ready to attack each day. On the inside, I feel defeated. In the end, you found somebody new, which is fine. I chose, whether consciously or unconsciously to stay on a different path. I've tried new women. Many beautiful on the outside, but they aren't you. Oh no, no, no. They all don't have what you had. Not even close. Maybe one day I will end this crusade against myself, against the past. I can't change it, I can't alter the story, I can't lie to myself. I wish I could tell you I'm sorry. But it wouldn't change anything. For you it's a battle that was fought long ago. For me, I relive it more times than I'd care to admit. I'm emotionally crippled, distraught, defeated. It's been a long three years. I'm ready for it to be over. I'm sorry. Yours truly, Me.

"Advice To preface this, I wanna say that I feel pathetic/incompetent/exhausted. Female, 30, currently staying at a hotel because I had to leave the house I was living in because of a conflict that recently happened. I got into a verbal argument with my sister (34) that resulted into a physical altercation. She screamed ""Go kill yourself"" and then shoved me and scratched me. My father was a witness to this. I then called the cops because i felt unsafe, she got so angry and turned a bit violent. (This is the third time she's told me to go kill myself and my parents haven't told her anything). Right before the cops came she was arguing with my dad and told me to ""Shut the f*** up! The cops arrived I told one of the cops my side of the story and she told hers. She said that I attacked her and that there were scratch marks on both her arms. I told the cops how could that be when none of the nails on my right hand are very short (I swear to you I couldn't have scratched seeing since I had no nails on one hand. The nails on my right hand are VERY short because they all broke due to cleaning the kitchen cabinets etc). The cops didn't believe me. My sister also claimed that I'm ""bipolar"" which I'm not. So the cops believed my sister and took me away on a 5150. I was released 3 hours later because the case manager said I didn't have any mental health issues. The funny thing is that I told my parents that I wanted permission to use their car to leave that house because I couldn't handle the stress that came with living with her. I would eventually return the car once I moved, got myself established etc. The stress has caused me to lose 3 pounds this week alone. After returning from the behavior health services, I gathered my bag and one suitcase and left. Currently, I'm staying at a hotel. What hurts most of all is that my parents have never told my sister to stop telling me to kill myself. It's as if thy don't care. This is such a shitty experience that I wouldn't wish upon anyone. I'm a hotel with no car, no friends, no home. Is it bad that to think that I just wanted my parents to tell her to stop telling me to kill myself. I feel like I'm asking for a lot. What do you guys think?

"My mom asked me:""What held you back"" Today I went down to the city,I walked around for a while I went down to the river and stood there for a while than I went up to the bridge and stared down.I ran away from home.I didn't have my phone.My parents didn't know where I was.We had an argument for at least 8 hours and I just had enough.I had depression since I was 9(I'm 15).My mom always said I was just imagining it.When I got home they started yelling at me(rightfully so,I was away for 2 hours they were about to call the police,but I had to be alone for a while).An hour ago my mother asked me why didn't I just jump off if I have a ""missarable"" life. All I could think of were these two things:1.I should have done IT 2.I was right about her Any comments?

"Exercise will make you feel better! Is what everyone says. So I listened and signed up for a gym membership. Fast forward one year later, I've become *so* obsessed with the image of my body and being as thin as possible, I overexercised and underate, so on top of my depression, I messed up my health and I developed an eating disorder which is making me far more depressed. It wasn't supposed to be this way. I think I'm about to lose my mind.

"These parents physically hurt their teenage daughter by burning her with hot oil and hitting her with broomsticks due to her refusal to marrying a man much older than her who is paying $20,000. This horrendous story just goes to show that your family isn't always this happy loving caring group of people who want the best for you. Sometimes your family can be toxic and parents can be bad at their jobs, and it's very important to know when to say no, and walk away if you can. Especially if your culture and religion like this young girl tells you to never say no to your parents and obey their commands no matter what, It becomes very hard to go against them and say no, but it is essential to draw that line for your own safety. https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/parents-daughter-abuse-forced-marriage-texas-cooking-oil-beat-bexar-county-maarib-al-hishmawi-a8274001.html

"Got rejected again today. I have had this massive crush on this girl for a while now and we been getting along really well. I was suprised to find out we had quite a bit in common and I felt so giddy every time I talked to her. I decided today I would suprise her with an early Valentine's Day gift and maybe she would like it. Nothing huge, I got her favorite snack and a brief note telling her how I felt. I don't know what I was expecting but she read it the note and walked away with the gift. She texted me a few minutes later she was nervous to reject me because she knew I was afraid and she would like to stay friends. I can't blame her for how she feels, it's her choice. Although, I feel utterly defeated. I have never been on a date or been kissed, or in any relationship with someone. I thought maybe this would be it, but I was wrong. On top of all the other shit going on in my life, I don't see a good reason to continue this fruitless struggle to survive.

"A Letter to My Future Self: Self Love Dear (future) B, This letter may be fragmented. This letter may be short, or it may be long. This letter may be emotional. Most importantly, this letter is to show you that you can stay grounded despite the rush of emotions you experience when you feel vulnerable and [falsely] unloved. Everything you thought you knew since that day (October 21st) has become unraveled within the last fourteen hours. Itâs hard to find the words that can sum it all up in order to save some time and space within this letter. This letter is also not about those specific events but about you and only you, and how far youâve come; it all plays into being able to deal with whatever the future may bring. As you admitted this morning, to yourself and G, your sense of clarity evaporates when you begin to feel vulnerable. It leads you to a self-fulfilling prophecy - the exact neediness you exhibit will do the exact opposite of what youâd like it to do and will therefore lead you to feeling ever more âneedy.â Listen to me: You are not validated by someoneâs ability (or lack thereof) to love you. And again: Sometimes, it is not simply not about you. So far in your healing process youâve managed to understand the importance of detachment. Youâre making wonderful progress and I hope that at some point you are still progressing. Your existence is for you and for you only. It is not okay or healthy to live solely for another human being. Remember that you are not âincompleteâ without someone however that someone can enhance the you that you already are. A relationship consists of two people working together as a whole yet existing as their own sense of âwholenessâ outside of the relationship. That is so very important for you to remember for the rest of your life. Remember when you felt vulnerable just a few weeks ago (sometime in November) and wanted to dive into texting that boy in order to make you feel better about yourself? And then remember that you didnât because you kept your clarity and understood that it was a coping mechanism. Donât forget that youâve done that not only once but a few times now and that is exceptional. I understand future Bri may encounter some setbacks and that her well-being might as well be a roulette wheel, but thatâs exactly what this letter is for. As youâve been told, you are luminous. You shine bright. Your heart is [almost too] huge. You have the potential to do great things. You are not your illness and you are not your insecurities. The grave you will lay in one day will only consist of you and nobody else. If the world ends and you survive, you have yourself. You have to keep this mind every single day. Work on self love and understand your worth. Yes, G makes you feel like the most important girl in the world. But before you can let him do that, you need to understand that you are the most important girl in the world to yourself, for yourself. Youâre done putting your interests aside just to receive love for the night/day. Youâre done with getting angry at the phone for not getting responses quickly. Youâre done feeling unimportant or unloved because youâre not someoneâs first priority. In the month and a half since the breakup, you have transformed. It is only the beginning but you have taken steps in the right direction. Future B needs to look back on this whether sheâs in a good spot at the time or not. She needs to know that even though she may not be at a point in life she envisioned, she did something for herself. When you feel like heâs pulling away, donât push harder. When you feel like you want to run to him in order to silence your overwhelmingly surfacing insecurities, understand that will not make things better. Understand that they are amplified and you are only expressing coping mechanisms in order to deal with the underlying issue. The issue isnât that he doesnât love you but that you make yourself unloveable. Understand that when you get into that mindset and lose grasp of the clarity, someone moving mountains for you will not fill that hole of pain. The only person on the face of this Earth that can fill that hole is you. You have the capability of moving mountains on your own when you remember these things. Continue doing your research. Continue taking time for yourself. Continue setting your phone down for hours at a time. Continue living your life out and letting others play a part and not the center role. Youâre the star of your life, you lead the show. Your family, friends, boyfriend, colleagues - they play their roles in your story. Most importantly, they play their lead role in their own stories and similarly you are character. Learn to appreciate silence. Learn to appreciate a bit of loneliness and solitude. Self-love includes coming home from work to take a hot bath and drink a glass of red wine, not rushing over to whoevers house in order to feel loved by someone else. You cannot be loved appropriately if you cannot love yourself first. Isnât it just like me to start taking the advice Iâve been given by so many people my entire life. Love yourself. Respect yourself. Appreciate your own time. Respect others. Respect otherâs need for space. Live for you. Again, love yourself. With love, B, 12/3/2017.

"Need advice on a friendship! Need advice on a friendship!So Iâve written on here a few times about this crush I had on this straight guy I worked with at work for a little over 6 months or so. To summarize it, in those short months or so we became friends I guess u can say. We both are a year apart, he likes sports, music, and video games, etc. Anyways I developed a crush on him and I couldnât handle the fact it would never happen, so I said to myself to try and make this friendship something memorable. We hung out 3 times outside of work, the third time was kind of quick but it was still outside of work and it happened last Friday, which I loved not only was I trying to catch up with him since we hadnât hung out since December and itâs already March. So to put in perspective, I know itâs long but bear with me, it seems like our friendship is awkward at time, thereâs long silences in between, donât really have much to say. I mean for me itâs hard already hard enough for me to engage in a long convo, Iâm sort of shy but Iâm trying to break out of it, and donât really have much to say, it sucks because I feel like Iâm ruining a friendship that could be great. He kind of has the same personality when Iâm with him. I donât really have many friends well because theyâve all have been assholes to me, so I really donât have many people to talk to when I want to. So what do u guys of my friendship with this guy? Is it me or do u think itâs complicacted? Just another one I donât I ever receive text messages from him saying whatâs up or checking up on me. Now take for granted he might have a lot of friends so idk. Iâm usually the one who texts first

"What happened? Hi guys, Just wondering if any of you have experienced this. I grew up in the happiest family ever. My mom and dad were always so happy and positive about everything in life. I'm 30 now, things have changed so much. It is mainly my mother. She is very negative about everything. Nothing ever gets her excited, she doesn't want to do anything. She doesn't want to have family to visit them anymore. She doesn't really want to go out. As long as she's at home with her dogs she's ""happy"" She is basically miserable and moody every single day. I really don't understand it. She was never like this. Have any of you had this? What did you do to deal with it? It's like she prefers being negative over anything. Nothing gets her excited. Nothing makes her happy? It's so shit.

"What's wrong with my dad and what should I do about him? (sorry for the long post) I wasn't sure where to post this, so I just put it under r/family. A bit of background info: My parents have been divorced since I was 4. For as long as I can remember, my dad's been threatening the things I like to keep me in line. When I was 5 or 6, I had a pet bird that he often threatened to kill or release into the wild if I didn't play the piano. These days, he threatens to sell my phone and my computer (which he knows I need for homework) when I don't attend swim practice at a club I've been going to for years. He's also tried to use me to threaten my mom by refusing to pay for my braces (which cost about $5000) because her arthritis has been preventing her from taking me to swim practice. Not to mention she's unemployed. He's also said some pretty hurtful things about both of us when he's gotten mad. He called me egotistic and has told me a couple of times that he no longer looks forward to picking me up from my mom's house, and he's called my mom negative and accused her of not putting in the effort to give me a good childhood. He often tries to guilt-trip me when I piss him off, usually by telling me about how much effort he puts into raising me and how he does everything while I waste my time on my computer. There was a point back in 6th and 7th grade when he was pretty much a textbook case of emotional abuse, but he's improved since then and it gave me hope that he'd stop the threats and angry rants. Also, he rarely goes through with his threats, although that doesn't make them any less hurtful. Besides the threats and somewhat frequent outbursts, he's a generally normal parent. I can get my mom to file for a full transfer of custody, but I'm afraid she can't handle the financial burden of having me full-time. I'm also a little suspicious of her because I remember her hitting me before my parents divorced, even though she denies it. However, she's a much better parent than my dad right now. So my questions are: Should I consider my dad abusive? Should I take action?

"I don't feel well. Hey, I'm a highschool freshman and this has been the lowest I've ever been from the past three years of feeling like I should be gone. Buckle up your seatbelts because this'll probably be pretty long. Since the beginning of this year, I've been wanting to die; I feel so lonely and as if nobody actually cares about me. So, there's my primary friendship group; the people I hang out with the most. All of my (2) ""genuine"" female friends pretty much don't give two shits about me because I tend to act really clingy to them and other people because I've been friends with them since first grade and don't want to lose them. One of my female friends is kinda popular and she barely talks to me, and I just feel like I'm undeserving of her time or something; she's also kinda claimed my other female friend, so I don't get as much time to hang out with them as I used to. My guy friends are also a bit popular and they also happen to be dating my two female friends lol. They do make me feel happy talking to them, and I do hang out with them a lot, but sometimes I feel like I shouldn't be hanging out with them all that much because then I'm ""stealing"" them from my friends. I also get pretty bummed not being in a relationship when my other friends are, and I do feel like I'm not needed amongst any of my friends. (Basically, I just feel like the rebound when one of my friends aren't there). Can we actually talk about one of my female friends a bit more, actually? We'll call her M and my other female friend B. We met M last year and we invited her to hang out with us during our lunches. M was going through a tough time and we helped her out all the time and it was great making a new really close friend. She was really fun to talk to, but I don't know...sometimes she says some shit to me that makes me kinda bummed. I remember telling her how I felt kinda depressed once, and she said something along the lines of ""Stop asking for attention and actually do something"". Another time, I was hanging out with B's boyfriend, but the next day, M was mad at me and told me I shouldn't take him from B (which I do get and feel bad for, but B is totally cool with it and understands how me and her boyfriend hang out :p) Recently, (I don't remember what initiated the conversation really) M and I were talking (which rarely happens anymore), and she was talking about how she feels like she doesn't have anyone that actually cares for her, when she has so many people that clearly do care about her and love her. Then she proceeds to tell me to actually go and make friends again. I hate being petty and talking about other people, but I just don't feel comfortable being very close to her anymore and I'm not sure she's interested in talking to me either. So then that leaves like two male friends, and again because they're in relationships with B and M, I'm trying to pace myself with hanging out with them so one of them don't get upset. It's also pretty hard to make friends in a school where most people are white and really attractive, or already have their place. I'm a non-attractive Asian female that tends to make weird jokes and seem really masculine with the way that I mainly put forward, and I just don't fit in anywhere. I have a lot of anxiety of what people think of me, so then I sometimes struggle with talking to people. I wouldn't say people dislike me at all, it's just that nobody would hang out with me outside of school and it's hard to find people that are willing to spend time with me. There's also the problem with others' expectations of me;; Almost all my life, I've been deemed ""smart"", which has caused so much pressure and anxiety throughout the years. My parents really want me to do well in school, and peers think I'm so great at everything. I *thought* it would go away after elementary school, but even here, people consider me being so ""smart"" and able to do anything. With currently a ~95 average in my classes, it's extremely difficult to maintain that and I feel like if I do any worse, someone is going to get mad at me. People expect me and think I'm so good, but really I'm just average at literally everything I do. I also have no idea what I want to do with my life. I'm not very good at anything, and I have so many interests, it's hard to pin down something that I *should* do with my time. Nothing really interests me enough to do it for like 25~40 years of my life, and the things I would be interested in have literally no way of making a living off of or is something totally unachievable. I feel like I can't make any difference to anyone in the world, and I'll die not making an impression on anyone or having anyone really care about me in the end. I've been hurting myself since about third grade, mostly from scratching myself with my nails until it leaves a mark for a few days and hitting myself on the back of the head. It's extremely satisfying and I feel like it's a good thing to punish myself for being such a waste. So that's pretty much the gist of it, I guess? Mostly just problems with self worth and having others view me a certain way. There is some other stuff, but nothing that I can really think of at the top

"My male cousin stopped talking to me all of sudden. Let's call my cousin Bobby. My mother is the oldest daugther and my aunt (her sister, and Bobby's mother) is the youngest, with an age gap of 15 years old and even though they weren't really close (my mom moved to another province when she turned 18 and didn't came back to where we live now until she was 43, 2 years after my birth), we used to see each other at least 2 times in a week. I'm an only child while he is the youngest of 2 sons and since he's only 3 years older than me, my mom and my aunt thought it'd be nice to make us spend time together. We got close, really close and were like inseparable. But when he turned 12 or 13, he did stop talking to me, all of sudden. He doesn't say hi to me when he and his family visit us. Hell, he doesn't even look at me when I open the door. A year ago, during New Year's Eve, we were sitting in front of each other during dinner and I was staring at him because he looks really good now that he lost the acne. He noticed what I was doing so I moved my gaze to one of my cousin's baby and when I looked back at him, he avoided my gaze. I told my friends about him and they say that he must be embarrassed about something but I dunno about what or why since he never did something weird or bad to me. All of my other relatives told me he would start talking to me again when he got older and mature. But oh surprise: he is now 20 and at college, and he still doesn't talk to me and avoid my gaze.

"How are you? I am not okay. Iâm in a kind of adverse situation, my thoughts are all over the place and I really donât know how to break this cycle. Basically what happened was that a few days ago, I sent my best friend a message before school, saying that I wouldnât attend classes because I wasnât feeling too well, that I felt like giving up and that, in case I also wouldnât have been at school the following day, I had probably killed myself. I wasnât joking. Sometimes I get these sort of âimpulsesâ, most likely caused by me being overwhelmed by my emotions, my thoughts, and as a result of that, it feels as though I lose my common sense, my ability to think rationally. My thought patterns become unpredictable, but so far Iâve managed to not act on them, or else I wouldnât be writing this right now. Currently theyâve been happening a lot more frequently than usual and that seriously freaks me out because during those times death seems like such a good solution to my problems. So, back to the story. Obviously, my friend got really concerned and encouraged me to come to her place because sheâd been staying at home that day. BUT she also contacted my mom, which I didnât know until hours later, and told her that I wasnât at school and made a concerning remark, but I donât know exactly. My mom started to call me like every minute and I started to panic because I thought a teacher had called her, so I didnât pick up any of her calls. I spent the rest of the day with my friend, but called my mom in the afternoon. She asked my where I was and it sounded like she was crying and I told her that I was at my friends place, but after that she declined the call. That night I slept at my dads place, my mom called him and told him that she didnât care anymore about what I was doing and that kind of hit me. It was the last thing I wanted to hear in that situation. I just donât know what to do. I really do feel miserable. My friend is beating herself up because she thinks itâs all her fault and I donât know, I just feel bad for feeling bad, if you know what I mean. That message was a cry of help in a kind of way and I donât understand why my mom reacted the way she did. It just makes me think that maybe everyone is really better off without me. Iâve been depressed for nearly five years now, but my mom never really paid attention to it and just marked me down as lazy. Iâve been doing great for a good six months in 2017, but then somebody really important to me, somebody that kept me going, passed away in December and since then everything had taken a turn for the worse. Life has become so hard for me, Iâm sleeping the days away because I canât bear the thoughts, the guilt, because Iâm too much of a coward to face reality. Iâm trying, I really am, but no matter what I do, this feeling, this feeling that eradicates my will to live, remains.

"I know I am depressed but I have no energy to do anything to counter it. I've been searching for a job for 4 months to no avail (I used to have an office job for 4 years before quitting it to take a leap of faith to migrate to another country), and from the second month onward, I've plunged deeper and deeper into depression. Back then in uni days, I was diagnosed with clinical depression and was put on medications. I've been off them since my graduation, because I didn't want to depend on them for the rest of my life and I didn't really have the funds to continue the treatment back then. These days I feel exactly like I am slogging through those low energy periods again. My mind would never shut down at my usual bedtime and at times anxiety would keep me awake until 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning. My biological clock is a total mess, in the morning I would just sleep in and refuse to wake up, even though it's already past noon. I tend to shy away from as much social interaction as possible; I just plainly don't want to meet anyone, it freaks me out and makes me uncomfortable. I even refuse to answer any emails or continue the dreary job searching and job application. I know that I am in a big mess. I disgust myself for my lack of energy and determination to do anything. But then when I'm faced with the colossal task at hand, I'd chicken out, then I'd sleep on it, hoping that everything would somehow sort themselves out, only to find myself wake up in the next morning groggy and lethargic. Nothing has changed, and I'm still deep in depression.

"What's wrong with me? I just want to know what's really wrong with me, should I get help or something...I often think about myself like I'm a negative person. Some people describe me as cold as I don't really have any genuine reactions to anything just pure neutrality some even say I lack empathy. I keep most of my feeling and thought for myself and the only thing that's wierdly funny to me is dark humor and misfortune of others. My attitude on the outside, most of the times, is ""I don't care"", but when I'm alone, then shit goes down, anxiety, depression, dark thoughts you name it. I can go days without seeing anyone or speaking to anyone when I'm in this pit of my own making. But then again, I still have this slight need to socialise after some time. The thing is, some time ago, one of my closest friends asked me, what made me happy, when was the last time I was truly happy? And what worried me, I couldn't think of anything, still after thinking for like an half our, there was nothing. Don't get me wrong, I still laugh and sometimes even smile, but for me positive and happy people seem fake. Anyone in a similar situation? Some advice would be appreciated.

"Iâm glad none of my close friends know I have reddit If my friends knew how depressed I was and I how serious I am about committing suicide they would probably put me in some inpatient program.

Everyday is a constant struggle to stay alive and I hate that thereâs still a month and half left until the date I chose. I should probably write my letters soon just Incase I donât make it.

"I cut off my best friend because she was a flake NOW she wants me back ( Am I wrong for declining?) **TLDR**: I cut off my Best friend of 5 years for being flakey and unreliable this summer. She tries to guilt trip me into taking her back. She bought me a gift while visiting in Korea and wanted to give it to me this Saturday. I said ok at first but sent her a text this morning declining the gift and the offer. I feel guilty. Am I wrong? **Long Story (detailed)**: My friend and I had been friends since high school ( I am now 23 and she is now 21). I ended our friendship this summer after giving her numerous chances over the years. Long story shortish, she would never keep her word when it came to meeting up, she was super inconsistent and only really reached out when it was convenient for her. She would always be ""too busy"", she'd change our plans to hang out with others, or she'd flake out all together and not call or show. We both went to separate colleges in different towns so meeting up was hard and hanging out regularly was pretty difficult. I was always the one who would reach out to see how she was doing and I was always the one to initiate are hang out sessions. We would make plans to meet up a month in advance and the week of our planned day, she would flake out. After a while, I started calling her out and she would beg and cry exclaiming that she would change, but she never did. I would text her and she'd never text back. I called her once after a hard day at school and she rushed me off the phone but whenever she would call me for help and advice I was always there front and center ready to listen. I would ask her to help me out and she bail at the last minute due to scheduling conflict or her failing to think ahead. I once asked her to pick me up from the airport. I asked 3 times if she was sure if she could and she reassured me that she'd be able to. A couple of days before the day that she was supposed to pick me up, she calls me talking in circles only to tell me that she couldn't do it. I was broke and couldn't really afford a lyft. Luckily I was able to reach my dad. Over the summer things got even worse. She turned 21 and I had tried several times to link up and take her out. She bailed both times. The first time she bailed because I guess she forgot that she needed to pick up her aunt from the airport. The second time she made date night plans with her boyfriend. It continued to persist. she was teaching me how to drive but didn't think enough of me to let me know when she was going to cancel. Instead, she ghosted me for a week only to blame it on the fact that she was too busy to text me or call me. In September, I had had it! I deleted her on facebook and i blocked her number. She added me back a week later and then I blocked her. Feeling bad, November I reached out one last time to see if we could talk things through. She said that she missed me and was too sad to talk in person and that she need time to process what happened. I rolled my eyes at the text and said whatever. Toward the end of the month (November 19th to exact) she reaches out to me telling me about how sorry she is how awful of a friend she was. I vented my frustrations and she said apologized and alluded to wanting yet another chance. I said ok and we planned to meet on December 22nd. A few days before December 22nd, she texts me saying that the 22nd didn't work for her. She tried to place the blame on me by saying that I knew that she had job training that day and that I should've picked another day. I went off, She begs, I say whatever. Sometime goes by and we talk again and I explain everything that is on my mind. I tell her that its cool to be busy but its also important to make time for the people in her life. She didn't really respond because I guess it was finals week on her end. I told her that I would always be there for her and I wished her the best of luck. On New Years she texted me telling me that she had been thinking about me and she wished me a Happy New Year. I did the same. A few days later she texts me saying that she bought me a gift in Korea (where she had been visiting) and I said ok? I was a little irritated because I know that it was just another nice-nice sappy guilt trip manipulation ploy. We settled for meeting up on Saturday. however after thinking about it, I texted her today and told her that meeting up isn't a good idea. I told her that while she is a very sweet person and that I appreciated the gift, I do not trust her. I told her that I have since moved on and healed from the situation. I included that if she wanted to speak on the phone on Saturday that we could but outside of that I would not feel comfortable meeting up and hanging out. She texted me back a little short saying ""Oh ok"" and she asked if she could text me later. I said sorry and told her to take care. *Am I wrong? I feel a little guilty for how messy

"This sub is useless I don't want to appear pessimistic or a negative person, but I do really believe this sub is useless. This is the usual happening on this sub, op posts ""i feel like shit because I have no friends""/ ""life sucks"" /""I want to feel normal"" and other redditors reply with ""yeah same"" /""i understand""/""I feel like shit too"". I mean, what kind of reaction one expects from posts like this? I realize that op doesn't really want advices, he just wants to vent and I admit I've done the same, but honestly, did I feel better? Did I feel better after I realized other people are suffering with me? No. Maybe if I told a friend, to my brother that I'm feeling like shit, maybe, I would feel better,but to unknown people on the internet? What they tell me is worthless. I don't need to feel comforted or understood, I need help from people and receiving advices on how I can improve my life or stories of people feeling better. Something which is really lacking on this sub. I want to feel better and I don't care about intellectualizing my pain or feel comforted. If one day I feel I have no hope and no chance of feeling better I will kill myself. Today sucks, but tomorrow might not, so let's just try doing tangible efforts. Thanks for reading.

"Iâm losing the girl Iâve been with for 7 years and itâs because of my drug use, really bummed Iâve been with this girl since 9th grade Iâm now 23 and I can honestly say I love her with my whole heart. Iâve been abusing drugs of all variety since I was 15, herion, meth, pills, uppers, downers, alcohol, marijuana, research chemicals, it doesnât matter, but I prefer if it fits into a syringe. I have been to rehab 9 times since I was 15 Iâd get sober then relapse sober then relapse sober etc.. I have had legal trouble and been in and out of jail she has been with me through it all, she has always been my better half. No words can explain how blessed Iâve been to have her. This past relapse I was clean for two years before hand and our relationship had never been better we were both happy we both trusted and we both loved no matter what. She helped me get my g.e.d. And she helped me through my grandfathers death (he raised me). I had subtle depression over it I felt like that was normal losing a loved one and all, but I eventually stopped doing the things I was susposed to to maintain my sobriety, I felt like I was cured and no longer needed all the recovery stuff. I was wrong. So one day I decided to take some benzodiazepines and that made me go straight to crystal meth in the time frame of a week I was back shooting meth spending all of my money on it and staying up for days. When on meth I have serious delusions I accused her of cheating on me I actually believed these delusions with my whole heart I felt so betrayed and hurt, I wanted to die. What I feel like really did it was I accused her of cheating on Facebook. Even after multiple people telling me I was wrong I couldnât believe it, I just KNEW everybody was out to get me especially her, I was very unfair and called her names and called her at all hours of the night, completely out of character of me. After being the good loving boyfriend she knows and loves for two years I suddenly became a monster. I totaled the vehicle I owned and went to jail for possession with intent (Benzodiazepines) possession of marijuana and dui. I sat there for two months (thank god) while I was in there she told me she just couldnât do this with me anymore and told me she has somebody else in her life, this crushed me. I contemplated suicide while I was in there fought anybody that even remotely rubbed me the wrong way and lost my appetite couldnât sleep. So I get out and I know that I should just stay away from her because I love her and I donât want to hinder her pursuing something else, I respected her decision to move on, after all I did publicly humiliate her. So right now I have been sober a month and I feel good in a clear minded healthy way, but I have this hole where she used to be I find myself riding around for hours thinking and crying. Iâm very upset that I let this happen, currently I just canât keep my mind off of her I just want our love and friendship back. I am very depressed and lately I have thought about using again but I would rather kill myself before I do that, I canât get high anymore I would honestly rather be dead. Iâm going to NA meetings, going to church, praying all day, but I canât seem to ever feel better about losing her no matter what positive things I do. Iâd rather be dead then to live without her and I donât know what else to do.

"OPINIONS PLEASE/SISTER ISSUE Iâm a 43 year old single mom of a 21 year old son. I suffer from major depressive disorder, ocd, ptsd and anxiety. I work part time and live with my mother. Iâve had issues since I was a child. So I believe my sister and I can be jealous of each other. Her of me because Iâve had issues and me of her because sheâs normal. Our father passed away 4 years ago. Which was a devastating loss for all of us. I have lived and raised my son with my parents for the last 12 years or so. My sister moved away about 12 years ago and got married had two kids got divorced, had another kid and recently got married. She is a busy mother of 3 and working full time. After my dad passed my mother and I decided to move closer to my sister and her family. I admit I have issues and my sister is the type that I feel truly doesnât âbelieveâ in my issues. She sees me as lazy, crazy, etc. I see her roll her eyes when she thinks Iâm being too much. She never asks me to help her out I guess because of my issues. I moved here to be closer to her and I feel abandoned. She has no time for me. We are building a house together, my mom and I have an inlaw suite and my sister and her family have the main house. My mother has given them the money to put a down payment on this home. At times I am pissed especially when she throws in my face that there are certain things that I want in the building of the house that are going to cost extra. She is a hard core bitch at times. She hardly shows any love. Her job has her so tied up that she doesnât take care of herself, sometimes puts off taking her kids to the dr, she has no time to go out with us. She canât even take time to respond to any of my texts during the day. She makes fun of me in indirect ways, âI didnât really mean itâ when I have a memory issue (from depression treatments). But when I respond with FU it isnât quite so funny anymore and sheâs done with me. My mom is so torn she hates that we feel this way towards each other. My mom has been there for us both thru thick and thin, financially and emotionally. I just want a sister, someone whoâs going to have my back once my mom is gone. I have no one else. Help me, Am I just jealous of her? How do I fix this?

"I can't do school work and I have no will power left The past two years I've been having a mental battle with myself trying to do my work just to come out with bad grades and disappointment from myself and my parents. I don't if I'm depressed, an idiot, or just a lazy piece of shit but I'm tired of fighting and I just want to throw in the towel. I know my parents just want the best for me but they can't help me. Even when I'm in class it takes all my mental strength to do the simplest things like take notes. The most frustrating part is that nobody thinks I try to do anything. Everyone treats me like a complete dumbass because I can't do my work. I used to have an amazing memory when I was 5-6 years old but when I started elementary school and now it gets worse and worse every year. Sometimes I'll talk to someone and forget what we're talking about in the middle of the conversation for a second. I can't organize anything and I give up before I even try because I know in my head I won't be able to do it anyways. I couldn't pay attention in class if you payed me to do it. And I hate myself for it. I hate that I can't do simple tasks and I that I can't remember anything but I can't control it. It doesn't even feel like I'm in control of my life anymore. Is there anything I can do to help myself. I'm trying to change my diet and meditate as of recent. I want to be in control of myself again. I'm only in 8th grade and I feel like here's one last chance of hope before I trash my gpa and end up working at McDonald's. If you can think of anything that might help please reply. I might just do an lsd trip for insight to find a solution but I'm worried I'll just mess with my brain even more. Anything you Can think of will be great.

"I kinda like being depressed after dealing with anxiety As a lot of people, I have both depression and anxiety disorders. Basically a thing happened in July, which caused me to have constant panic attacks and overall brutal anxiety until around October, when I just transitioned into deep depression. It was however a big relief. I was completely empty, I didn't care about anything. It was 100x better to me than fucking anxiety. When I'm depressed, I don't feel 'bad'. I don't feel good either, but I'm fine with that. I don't feel anything, it's kinda relaxing. The downside - when I was in the deepest state of depression I was really close to killing myself and I also threatened to shoot up the school, after which police took me to a mental hospital. I've been here for over 3 months now. I did some really bad things, I acted really bad, but on the inside I felt better. When I'm anxious I don't do mean things to people, but on the inside I'm dying, I feel vulnerable and just want help. I understand that depression is awful and people suffer from it, I see what it does to people on this sub. I just wanted to add my experience, since it's different to everyone else's. Anxiety makes me feel like I'm having a heart attack, like I'm going crazy, I sweat, I shake, it feels literally like torture. Depression is the exact opposite. It's calmness, not giving a shit about anything, basically relaxing. I feel kinda comfortable being depressed. I lie on the bed and look at the ceiling, at the wall, whatever. Like I'm on autopilot. Right now I have both, which just feels fucking weird, I can't even describe that. Sorry if I offended anyone. I know some people prefer to feel something, but I'm fine with being an empty shell. tl;dr - depression &gt; anxiety for me.

"Why does my mom keep talking to me? She says Im not nice like I used to be. She was like the older I get the more understanding i should be. She also feels like I should seek wealth. But that's not something I want. I want personal growth and wisdom and strength. I know a lot may disagree and say money is what matters. Yes it does. But it's a tool. Also, I do dislike my mother because she messed up my head as I grew up. She always told me her issues. Parents should never tell kids their issues. I am 22 now and she feels like she can still change the way I am. But in my opinion, the first three years is what shapes most of a person. I want to move out. I want to buy a bike, a tent and a sleeping bag and leave... what do you guys think?

"A bad relationship and my current state of mind I'm 21 and i'm going to share some of my experience. So, i meet this girl on the internet in my later 17's , i was an active practitioner of Karate Kyokushin, Muay Thai and Box back then, i was about to enter in the amateurs and start to compete, i even went to japan 2 times on the championship and training grounds. Then, i meet this one girl , i had just left an relationship with another girl that end up with her cheating on me and well..i was even younger than now and i knew it how to fight, so..I beat the crap out of the guy and was disgusted by woman and by fighting like that again , i was so frustrated that i was traded by a 14 old boy (geez) but i overcome that. When i meet this girl (I'd call her Kim from now on) i was clear about all that situation and that i was not up for a relationship with her or anyone else. She was earning a place in my heart because Kim seems so different from other girls and was treating me well, she respected my hobbies, my dreams (it was 5 months to 18 years and i was going to join the military because IT WAS MY DREAM) and myself as a ''man''. So, she visited me, i visited her, we were 2 states of distance of each other, but ''never too far to our love don't reach each other'' bullshit (387 Miles) and of couse we started to dating and have sex, and all the vows of love, you guys know what i'm talking.. Then i was on my 18, i had finished a test if i was join the military as a seargent or if i was enter like a corporal and I WAS SUCEED \o/ . But on the other hands, Kim, that i had met 6 months ago was through a rough part of her life, she had lost her job, she wasn't paying the bills and was about to get dumped from the house she was living (all alone) and then, i talked to my parents if i could help her by inviting her to come home with us, i was about to change my life, i was about to work twice as hard and so i did. I called her and say ''Hey, just sell your things, don't worry about it, we're gonna buy new ones baby'' Hell yea, like a fucking Alpha and she was so happy and she cried and she was all ''omg i love u so much'' Then i left all my trainings hobbies which gives me a lot of stress but i had back then a ''major reason '' for that and i was happy with her. Then Kim's past started to show up to us. A family of 5, me, my little brother, my mom and dad and now Kim. The thing is, Kim had a daughter that was with her aunts back then and she started to say she missed her, she was sad, she was feeling bad because she couldn't find a job yet (3 months had passed, it was a rough time on the Brazil enonomically speaking)but HEY, i had 2 jobs and i wouldn't give up, she was sad that i had to work so hard to : 1- Help my parents 2- ""Pay"" For her in the house. I was saving money too, because other than spending money with that 2 things i didn't have the time to do other things so some free time i had we would watch a movie, take some ice cream, have sex (a lot, geez) and that money that i was saving began to get bigger and bigger, till the point that i was thinking about buying some ground to maybe started to build our own house in the future when she get a job and started to help me . We would visit Kim's daughter from time to time and i start to love the girl, she was do damn smart but had a sadness in her that i could see, and one day in the house of Kim's Aunt, Her aunt came to me alone with Kim in the grocery store and started to say that i should stop my relationship with her. I was shocked by the comment, but cold as ice in the outside and just asked 'wth are u talking about ?"" then she started to say that Kim had beat her daughter so damn hard that almost killed her and that's why she was not with Kim anymore and she say Kim it's fckng crazy and all type of shit and i was pissed off. When we get back to home , i say to Kim what her aunt has spoken and she started to cry (and i was worried) and telled me a story (that isn't even worth bring it here for u guys) that in fact was another person who beat her daughter. Well, time had passed, we didn't talked about it anymore and we were hanging out and she turns to me and say ""What about we did a lil shot ? "" (That is the equivalent on Brazilian to ""LET'S SMELL COCAINE)i was ""What ?"" and she ""Yea, it will be fun, i will let you do it in my sexy belly if you want"" . It's unbelievable how someone so damn pretty and hot and smart and intelligent and perfect could turn into a fucking piece of shit so god damn fast. I refuse the ''offer'' and started to yell at her and started to talk some monstruous shit about it, like ""it was because of that you daughter almost died ?"" and everything, i was pissed off, sayed some shits that i shouldn't , she say it too but we

"I often ponder the idea of giving up completely. Has anyone given up completely? How does it feel like? I have had extreme depression for 11 years. For as long as I can remember I have tried so hard to stay alive. There was a point in my life where I gave up. I remember my mom was beating me and I put up my hands to block the belt and I was crying. I remember after one of the times she struck me I started to think âwhat if I gave up?â And I just shut down. In that moment I stopped putting my hands up, stopped crying, and rolled into a ball while mom kept beating me for a few more minutes. For a few years after that I stopped caring about my appearance. I got so fat and I just kept eating and eating. I stopped caring about my grades and didnât even try. I would just turn in a blank paper with my name on it. During high school I woke up and started to try again even though it was really hard. Since then I havenât stopped. I regularly do thing I donât want to do in an effort to make it by. I get up at 5, I shower every day, I go to the gym, I do my homework, study, etc. Currently, I have been working my butt off to be able to join the military to get away from my parents. My depression is acting up so much, itâs getting really hard to keep trying. I often find myself daydreaming and pondering how good/easy it would feel/be to just stop what Iâm doing and give up. Get in bed, stay in bed, go eat, eat some more, and more, finally not caring about my appearance and just not doing anything in general.

"I do want to live...just not like this. I remember when I used to be so happy at the world. Full of opportunities, believed that you could be anything you wanted, yadda yadda yadda... But it's as if reality hit me with a shovel and said ""no! you can't be happy. Be sad."" I can't stand how much of a failure I am, and how mediocre I am. I'm the ugly friend and women ignore me. Online dating is a joke. I hate my body with a burning passion. I'm bad at everything I do. Every attempt to feel positive is met with a ""no! you can't feel like this, and here's why"". It's like my brain is set to the ""negative"" setting by default, and I can't change it. Then I just give up and let myself succumb to the self-hate. Just wish I wasn't so damn shit. Wish I wasn't ugly. Wish I had a body I was proud of. Wish women didn't look down on me like I have the plague. Wish I had something to be proud of.

"I feel like culture is a big reason why a lot of people donât seek out professional help I donât know much about other cultures, but I live in a Hispanic/American household. I feel immigrantsâ families are typically a very work focused group. They expect you to just tough it out and push through everything . Most people in these communities donât see depression as an illness, but rather as an excuse for being lazy or unmotivated. Thereâs almost a macho type mindset that you arenât supposed to talk about those bad feelings and that shit really sucks. Itâs pretty much frowned upon to even consider looking for therapy because itâs âfor craziesâ. Iâve been chronically depressed for years but Iâm finally going to seek professional help Monday. Iâve been having suicidal tendencies for years and if I ever have kids, which I very much hope I do one day, Iâll be damned if they feel they canât come to me to talk about any bad thoughts.

"my cousin Long story short, I have an 8 year old cousin and I don't like him. I'm 19 going on 20 by the way. My mom babysat him when he was a newborn till when he was about 2. I always felt kind of jealous because my mom completely forgot about my dad and I when she babysat him but I always kind of understood that she wasn't doing it intentionally because kids are so high maintenance at that age. Anyways, fast forward to my teen years and his young kid years and I can't stand the kid. He's such a crybaby even for his age and he doesn't like me for some reason. It started because he was taking toys from my dog and my dog started crying, so I yelled at the kid and he started to cry. I don't think I was being over the top and the kid definitely had to have someone discipline him. My mom loves him a lot and always talks about him but it pisses me off because it seems like she cares about him and his dad more than her own husband and only son. The kid does nothing but play video games on his xbox or my mom's iPad when he stays with us, Which I failed to mention is a very common occurrence. I'm starting to ramble but the main goal of this post was to find out if anyone feels the same way about any of their younger family members or if I'm just a complete asshole.

"Is this my fault? I've been on SSI ever since high school but before high school I wasn't. My oldest aunt suggest to me to get SSI but let's call her Cancer Rat because her zodiac sign is a Cancer. I was like ""Nah, I'm good for now"" because I'm lazy I didn't feel like doing that but I didn't tell my aunt that! SO, she took it the wrong way and start yelling BLAH, BLAH THIS and BLAH, BLAH THAT. My mom was like ""Cancer Rat you cannot get mad because she decided not to do that!"" Cancer Rat gotten more mad ""I'm not mad, I was just saying."" I gotten tired of her yelling because she can't get her way. I was like ""Mom, let's just do it so Cancer Rat can shut the FUUUUUCK UP!"" My mom was like ""Ok, let's just do it. Let's get it over with."" The thing is ever since then I was in 3rd or 4th grade the relationship between Cancer Rat and I went down hill! I stopped going to church with is where is start going down hill. She got mad because I stopped going to church with her. From time to time Cancer Rat will bring it up to manipulate me to have me feel guilty about it but I caught on to it. She makes fun of my weight, hair, clothes I wear, what I eat and drink, just everything like she's overdramatic about every fucking thing I do but I'm probably ain't the only one though. It's so bad that I can't even read a story on the Wattpad without her bitch ass accusing me of texting a boy when I wasn't! She probably hates when I play video games. In 2016 she called me mentally retarded and said I don't think straight but I don't know why and if I ask her why she said that to me that she'll just lie, lie, lie of why she said it. She gets overdramatic when she's the last to find out shit or when you stop telling her shit, stop talking to her. I stop telling shit because you'll tell her not to say anything to anyone that she'll do it anyways. She did all of this ever since I was in 3rd or 4th grade and still is til this day.. Now you know my back story with Cancer Rat. Ever since 2014 I started to use Bitcoins and the only person knows I use it is my mom at the time but my brother started to find out and he ended up founding out. From 2014 to 2017 I will lose Bitcoins and wins or earn Bitcoins! Just like if I were to use the trade market, you'll win or lose some. In 2018 I wanted to make history by making thousands of dollars from a $29.00 Bitcoin investment and I did. The problem is that Cancer Rat daughter, let's call her Tuna Fish in her 30's. So I made 2 mil but the household only knew about it. Until I made a big mistake by making a youtube video about my 2 mil and shared the video to my Facebook! The mistake was sharing it to my Facebook page. Here's the thingâ¦Tuna Fish love to lurk on people Facebook pages using her husbands account and I wasnt paying attention until after my aunt Cancer Rat confronted me about my earnings 3 days after I shared the link to my Facebook. Cancer Rat yell and cussed at me that accused me of using SSI money to earn my 2 mil, that I did it behind everyone's back, that I didn't even bother to let her help, that I was being greedy, I didn't even bother to tell her, that she had heard it through someone else how they showed her proof, that the person had showed her a video of it, she's disappointed in me, she will forgive but won't forget, and that she feels lefted out. Here's the thing I did use SSI to get the 2 mil because back in 2015 and 2016 that Cancer Rat bâ¢tch ass sent a letter to them told a false story how I barely go places, that my mom have to do all the work, that I'm mentally retarded, that I rage on video games, other shâ¢t that I can't remember and one of the update application for SSI that Cancer Rat lied to them and said that I was in a wheel chair when I never was. So that's when I started to think that she might trying to get them to cut me off and thats why I used $29.00 of my SSI money to get the 2 mil as back up like I didn't think it was a big deal. It wasn't my fault to me because I wasn't the one sending letters trying to get someone cut off but my mom told me to not say anything about the letters when we had first found out and today is day to confront Cancer Rat. I had to do it. Now Cancer Rat wants to try and tell me what to do. She says ""Girl, whatever I say to you is for the best. Whatever you did to make that 2 mil that I want you to stop doing it because it's not fair that you made your first 1 mil before your 21st birthday. You didn't do anything specially to get it. I mean like you SAT ON YOUR ASS!"" She was pissed but I don't give a fuck. I said ""I had to do what I gotta do! It's not my fault that it happen. The reason why I turn $29 to 2 mil is because some bitch trying to sabotage my SSI by sending in false letters and I wonder who? Now you're mad because I made 2 mil before my 21st birthday OMG!"" so Cancer Rat

"No friends whatsoever. Living in isolation. Please help me I'm in my final semester of undergrad. I'm 24. I live in a university apartment. I have severe social anxiety. I've gone through therapy before, stopped for a while, and am now trying to find a new therapist that takes my insurance. Every day is almost total isolation. I go to class. I fantasize about working up the courage to talk to someone or say something in class but never do. I go back to my apartment. My randomly assigned roommates, all several years younger than me, keep to themselves. I am too afraid to talk to them. So I hole up in my small room and play video games or do homework. Day in. Day out. Rinse. Repeat. This has been my life for several years now. I'm incredibly insecure. I have some combination of body dysmorphia and an eating disorder. I'm probably quite good looking but I've never been in a relationship; I'm still a kissless virgin. This eats me alive and makes me afraid to talk to women. Another reason to isolate further. I'm losing touch with reality. I have loving parents but their advice isn't particularly helpful. What I want is a friend, someone to talk to--but the anxiety gets in the way. I can talk to people in a structured setting, like therapy, or online (and easily and freely at that). But it's the act of doing it in the real world, in a natural setting, that is just impossible. I fantasize a lot about killing myself though I don't think I could ever actually carry it out. If someone could just be there for me I'd feel better. But I've given up almost all hope.

"Opened up to a ""friend"" about my depression. It could've gone better. Hello, Reddit. I've never posted here before. I'm a bit nervous about sharing this story (I'm very shy, even anonymously), so I want to thank you in advance for taking the time to read it. I'm hoping that just getting it off my chest will help, even if only a little. Also, I'm sorry if this post rambles on a bit or is incoherent at all, I'm not in the best state of mind at the moment. Earlier today, during our school's lunch break, I opened up to somebody I trusted about my depression and anxiety. I've been on a steep downward spiral recently, and this person had taken notice that something was wrong. She sat me down, grabbed us a couple of sodas, and told me to spill my guts. Normally, I would have simply told her that everything was fine, and made some lame excuse like ""I didn't sleep well last night"" or ""I'm just worried about my exam scores"". But this was the first time that anybody had ever reached out to try and help, so I decided to be truthful. I thanked her for offering to listen, and explained that I had never shared this with anybody else, so I might struggle to fully express myself. She was understanding, and told me to take as much time as I needed. I was very careful not to unload everything on her, I basically told her exactly what I said at the start of this post: that I struggle with depression and anxiety, and that it's been getting a lot worse recently. Initially, it seemed like it was going well. She had several follow-up questions, some of which I wasn't entirely comfortable answering. However, for the first time in years I felt a genuine sense of hope, and felt like someone actually cared about me, so I answered them anyway. Eventually, she asked me what was causing all of this. I explained that while there are certainly things that contribute to my depression on a day-to-day basis, at the root of it, there isn't really a reason. It's just who I am, almost as if it's hardwired into my brain. It's hard to explain. Do any of you understand what I'm talking about? Anyway, this is where things took a turn. While I was trying to explain that, she stopped me and said: ""I'm sorry, I can't do this. I offered to help cause I thought you were just having girl problems, or school problems, or something. I didn't realize you were totally emo. We're not in high school anymore. Besides, you're a guy, just toughen up"". That last part stung. I knew that was a common sentiment in our society, but to hear it coming from her, someone I've been friends with since high school, really took me by surprise. I didn't know what to say, so I didn't say anything. I just kind of looked down at my lap. We sat quietly for a moment, until she got up and started gathering her things. As she started to walk away I said: ""I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable, I wasn't trying to do that."" She looked back at me and said: ""Look, a big reason I'm friends with you is because of your positive attitude. It's infectious, and I love that about you. But if that's really just a mask, then you should probably just keep the mask on if we're going to continue being friends."", and then she left. She texted me a few hours later and said: ""I hope you're able to move past your issues so our friendship can move forward"". I haven't responded, and don't plan to. I cry myself to sleep at night enough as it is without also worrying about maintaining a fake personality for her. I probably won't be opening up to anyone like that again anytime soon (except, of course, to all of you wonderful people on the internet). Deep down, I know that most of the people in my life wouldn't react the way she did. But I just don't think I can build up the motivation to try it, not when I struggle just to get up in the morning. I want to thank you all again. Not just for reading my story, but for being a part of this community. Depression and anxiety really suck, and nobody should have to suffer through them alone. ...I'm gonna go hug my pillow now.

Her mother and father may get a divorce so that makes this situation even worse. She can be really happy at times then really down. We get in fights sometimes but they are usually resolved. She always complains she is a bad gf because she treats me like shit. I forgive her for doing so because of her shit life. Today we were just talking casually and a few mins later she said I will kms on said date. Then I told her why would u. She said love u bye. We then went back and forth until I decided to leave her alone. She said she wasn't feeling ok. But I have never heard her give me a date before. Saying you will is one thing but a date means you have planned out how u want to go. I didn't tell my parents the full story and neither has she. She has tried killing herself before. I didn't know her at the time. She doesn't have any friends in real life and the ones she does have just use her. She is also behind in school which stresses her out. I will go into more details if anyone is willing to help me and thank u for hearing me out.

"Whatâs the point in living? Obviously with the title you would think Iâm sad and hate myself or am severely suicidal. In reality, thereâs truth to that, but I seriously do not see a point in living. Iâve tried different things to try and discover myself like spending 1500 dollars on camera equipment thinking maybe photography is my calling only to return it the next week. Iâve bought a jeep thinking maybe overlanding or off-roading is my thing and now Iâm in the process of selling it. I have 1 friend that I hang out with once a month. I have 2 real life friends that I text occasionally. I havenât had a girlfriend in several years now. Mind you I turn 20 years old tomorrow. I donât know what the next step in my life is? Who am I? Is there something more to me than just working then going home just to sleep all day? Iâve had a small problem with taking pain killers like oxy, vicodin, and codeine. I just donât find any joy in any part of my life. I donât want to die, but at the same time I wouldnât mind not waking up tomorrow. I just want a passion. Something to live for. I donât want to be like this, but Iâve tried different things all my life and Iâve lost all joy. Is there a way to discover myself? Is that even an actual thing? What am I missing in my life? I just want to look forward to living another day rather than dreading it. To clarify, I donât consider myself suicidal. I donât WANT to die. I WANT a reason to be alive.

"AIBU TO THINK that calling mum and dad ""mummy and daddy"" after a certain age is cringe? My sister is 30 years old and still refers to our parents as ""mummy and daddy"". I can't be the only one to find this totally cringey?? I could understand more if it was directed at them but it's to others to when talking about them. Today we went for a meeting with our landlord and discussing the smell of weed coming from the flat below. When she said ""I don't mind it so much myself, but it's just more when mummy and daddy come to visit I don't want them to be smelling it in the hall"". I felt like disappearing into the groundð Just me?

"Best friend has a bf and is MIA I want to start a thread for people who have best friends/friends who have been MIA as a possible result from having a bf/gf. Please share your stories and give advice to those who post. So hereâs my story: So my best friend of five years has had a boyfriend for over a year now. However, sheâs recently been MIA. There has been times where I hadnât seen her for two weeks or maybe a month, but this time it was a lot more. Despite living a few minutes away from me, I hadnât seen her in 2 months!! Every time I asked her to hang out she would say that she was busy, but she wouldnât suggest meeting another time. We barely texted around this time either, I was the one that mostly initiated the conversations. Although she was busy, she was able to meet up with her boyfriend plenty of times who happens to live an hour away from her. She would always post photos of them together in social media and I would honestly feel upset. Eventually, I asked her to hang out again and she said that she had plans to go to the movies that night with someone else(not her bf), but that I could join. So we went to the movies and she dropped me off to my house right after the movie because she had to wake up early the next day. So we didnât really talk (since itâs the movies) and I couldnât address how I felt about not seeing her since there was someone else there as well. Also, the only reason I saw her that one time is because I asked her to hang out. If I hadnât texted her, then she wouldnât have invited me and I wouldnât have seen her. After that I didnât see her for a while either and I wanted to meet with her in person so that I could speak to her. A couple weeks later we finally saw each other. The first thing I told her was how I felt upset because I felt like she wasnât making much of an effort to even talk to me or see me. I told her that we should see each other more and she agreed. She then caught me off guard by stopping me and saying âI know what youâre going to say.â She claims that she knew and that she had been feeling guilty for the past months. She then said that those months were kind of hectic because her bf was going through something. But thatâs it... she didnât apologize and it just doesnât sit right with me. All she said was how she felt guilty and then mentioned something about her boyfriend to justify her behavior for the past months. We hung out for a couple of hours, however her bf kept calling her and sheâd answer his calls during this time. Sheâd recently gone on a short vacation and I didnât know when sheâd returned to town until I saw a photo on Instagram of her and her boyfriend together. Iâm honestly very mad and I feel as though I canât say anything because I had already mentioned it. What pisses me off more is when she had just gone on vacation for two days and posted a photo of her boyfriend on social media with the caption âItâs only been 2 days and I miss you sooo much!!â Like are you seriously kidding me, you hadnât seen your friend in more than two months... Iâm honestly so mad and I feel like I canât tell her without her getting mad. Sheâll probably get defensive since it involves her bf and since I mentioned it before. Sheâs honestly the only best friend I have and I donât know what to do. I feel like Iâm starting to resent them and I donât want to. Is there any advice that anyone can give me?

"Hosted my sisterâs baby shower, only to be a second thought the next day Hi Reddit! Iâm wondering if Iâm being too emotional about this and could use your opinion. I flew from Utah to Boston and arrived Thursday morning on a red eye. From 6am Thursday to 3am Saturday, my mom and I prepped for my sisters baby shower. I see her once or twice a year, but the three of us talk almost everyday on a group chat, and weâre close. My mom and I stopped prepping briefly Friday night to meet her, her husband, and her best friend (who flew in that night) for dinner- so that was the first time I was seeing her this trip, same as her friend. The best friend stayed at her house while I was staying with my mom. So Saturday we had the shower for 25 people. Huge hit. Sister was very very appreciative and loved it. I had brought my suitcase in the event I slept over there, so I could have more time with her Sunday morning. This is generally normal. Once the shower wrapped, her friend brought my suitcase down...sort of a âhere you go, bye.â The main Sunday plan was to watch the AFC game back at her house, at 3pm. I woke up after some major sleep catch up at 10:30 and asked the mom/sister group text, âwhat should we do today kids??â To which my sister replied that her and her girlfriend are getting breakfast and meeting up with the girlfriendâs husbandâs cousin (who also lives in Boston) and that theyâd be back at the house at 2:30 before the game. My flight back to Utah is 6am Monday, so today (Sunday) was really the only time to see her. I didnât respond to that message. Around 1pm I told my mom that I didnât want to watch the game with them, and Iâd rather go downtown and watch it in a bar since I was feeling extremely hurt after putting all that work in for her shower, and then feel like an after thought the next day. So, Mom and I went to a bar and watched it. Sister and her husband blew up at me for being so âselfishâ and are not talking to me. Husband went so far as to say Iâm not welcome to see the baby when he comes. Crazy. I guess I should have put a smile on my face and just showed up for the game at 3? I would have if I ever stopped crying. Thoughts??

"I am so fucking lonely... My husband is my best friend. Hes my dude. And when hes busy I have friends to fall back on as well. Recently the whole family got back to back sickness and we were basically quarantined for two weeks just bumming around trying to get better. So I let my kid watch too much tv, let my husband play all the video games, so i could do my stuff with out being bothered as well. Let me also say, I didnt plant my kid in front of the tv for hours on end, but I have to shower, and keep up with the house because man colds are much more sever (no...). Now that were better his behaviors have continued, even though i have spoke to him many times; things wont be like this when were not longer sick. My kid isn't a tv kid and I plan to keep it that way as long as I can.. but he.. he doesn't want to spend time with me any more, just step away from electronics and just chill and talk and play with our kid together... so I wanted to talk to my friends or even my mom... and I realized I don't have very many friends. EDIT: I don't care about this getting up votes or anything but sharing it makes me feel a little less lonely.. also sorry for any spelling grammatical errors im usually obsessive but i feel like shit tl;dr: Husband plays games:: stops communicating with me :: Realized hes my only true friend.

"Why did they forget me? I was never someone people would consider anti-social. Rather, I was the opposite. I loved talking to people, meeting new people, and just being social. In highschool, I never had a ""group"" of friends per se, but I knew almost everyone in my grade, and was friends with a lot of them. After high school, I went to a local university, so I'd have to commute to my school, unlike the rest of my classmates who went to to schools further away. My current university is a huge commuter school, so there's no on campus experience to be had, and I'm actually transferring to a local community college instead, so I can transfer out later. Through all this, the friends I had in high school have all kind of forgotten about me. Even in high school, I'd be the first to message people, or the one to initiate hangouts and whatnots. But now, in college, its the same but so much more lonely. All my friends are away, and I'm rotting here. I feel so alone. On top of this, I miss my ex from a year ago. We went from meeting, to best friends, to huge fallout, to reconciliation, to best friends, to dating, to nothing. I miss the friend part. This loss has dampened my mood for a year now. Just overall, I feel so lonely. A year ago I felt on top of the world, and now, I'm back to shit. All I ever wanted was someone to message me first saying ""Hey dude, how are ya?"" Its been a while"". The worst was Thanksgiving break, where I had excitedly messaged a few people saying I'm so happy to see them and we (read: I asked to) made plans to hangout. A lot of them fell through. Others postponed till Christmas break. I messaged 28 people one day, desperate to talk to someone. I feel like I will never be anyone's ""everything"" ya know? I want a dog. Not just because its cute and all, but I want a companion that will never forget me, and will love me. I hate myself. Depression sucks. Loneliness sucks. I just want to cry.

"Fight! Fight! Fight! Hey Reddit community, I need to know if Iâm in the wrong in a certain situation... So a friend and I, lets just call him Kevin, have been good friends for years and have always gotten along (for the most part) pretty well. Earlier this week, though, he was poking fun at me about a certain rumor he had heard about me from a mutual friend of both of ours. The rumor was completely false and out of left field, so much out of left field, that I confronted the mutual friend and asked them what the fuck they were doing. Now, this mutual friend had told my friend Kevin about this rumor and they laughed about it and he made fun of me for it in a pretty brutal, but still jokingly, manner, but decided to drag me in front of the whole squad about it before he asked me whether it was actually true or not. It still bugged me, though, that this mutual friend was talkin shit to who knows who else, spreading this false rumor and whatnot, so I decided to control this mutual friend about the rumor. The mutual friend was surprised that I confronted them about it, and complained to Kevin and thought that it was âweirdâ that I would confront someone who was spreading false shit about me. Now apparently this mutual friend cut ties with me (I think itâs funny and I wasnât good enough friends with them to actually care), but Kevin is extremely angry at me and we havenât talked to each other or about it since, making me think that things will naturally go south. I admit I may have overreacted although I donât think Iâm in the wrong, so I refuse to apologize. Any advice, Reddit community? If I believe that I truly wasnât in the wrong, should I really apologize for how I handled this?

"Was it wrong to block my dad's phone? Was it wrong of me to block my dad? We had a massive fight that just escalated quickly, as we always do. My dad has a habit to threaten to disown me every time he gets angry. Once I pointed out how hurtful it was, and asked him to please not to say that, but nothing changed. So Iâm just trying not to respond to these angry text messages about how he wanted me to stop using their address because we are not family anymore. 20 minutes later he sends another message telling me to do as he says or he will embarrass me in an extended family group chat (he doesnât know that it doesnât bother me and he eventually carries out this threat later), and then 20 minutes later he offers me a deal where he would drop this address issue if I do a couple of things that he wanted. Sorry for being vague, the things he wanted were the things I essentially didnât want to do and is linked to what we had an argument about. From my perspective, I saw messages that were intentionally hurtful, about how I wasnât family, and then I saw a threat to shame me, and then I saw what looks like a way to manipulate or coerce me into doing what he wanted. It was very late at night and I had work the next day. That was the point I blocked his number (and I told him before I blocked it) and it is the first time ever in all 30 years of my life. However, now Iâm wondering if it was the right thing to do, because well, Asian parents always say shit like that and donât mean it, and I think my very drastic step would have upset both my parents a lot. An imposed silence also sabotages the opportunity for future open communication and is quite passive aggressive as well. If they were overreacting about the disowning me part, then I could have angered them to the point where they decide to go through with it. The next two days I unblocked my dad and sent some messages about how I was sorry I had to block my dad and clarified some of the things they were unhappy about (some of what they were unhappy about wasn't at all true). But I think both my parents have now blocked my number. Yet I can't blame them for doing that because I did it to them first, but I do wish I had just turned off my mobile, or been able to bear the burden of hearing shitty talk, instead of blocking my dad. (It's not possible to visit them as we live in different countries). Prior to this fight, I have been working through âabandonmentâ issues with a therapist. Not hard to understand whyâ¦ my dad always says things like âdonât call me dadâ and âdonât come homeâ, âdonât need a daughter like thatâ if I donât do what he says for as long as I can remember. My parents don't know this. Iâve thought about completely cutting my dad out of my life, but Iâm undecided as I feel like other people who have done it have more serious issues like abuse, violence, lying, and more about conflicts on serious issues like marriage, religion, sexual identity and child custody. Would really appreciate some 'Asian' perspective here, as most of my friends don't fully understand the cultural aspect of this.

"Does anyone else miss the person they used to be? I've always struggled with depression, but sometimes it's more manageable than other times. I've noticed that with every new year and myself getting older, I begin to look back on my past and long for it, even sometimes breaking down because I miss the person I used to be. I'm 23, so still young, but I really wish I could go back and be 19/20 again because that was when I was truly happy. I had moved out of my hometown, had lots of friends, a good relationship, I lost tons of weight and was confident for the first time ever, I traveled and worked for fun instead of working as a means of survival. I loved life, I had so much energy and such a bright outlook on everything and I had a lot of fun. Now, that's all over. I really only have one good friend left from those times and he doesn't even live near me anymore; sometimes I get really down when I think about old friends and start thinking about things I could've said differently that might've prevented the arguments we had that would eventually lead to the end of our friendship, I really never knew how much I needed them until they no longer wanted me in their lives. My relationship fizzled out in the same way and I've yet to develop a connection like that with anyone again. I've also gained all my weight back and can't stand to look at my own reflection. I don't know how to be happy like I was again. I look at old pictures from times past with old friends, destinations I went too and I want to cry because I just wish I could go back. I'm so depressed and hate myself, I'm incredibly lonely and am just a shell of the person I used to be. It's like I'm mourning my past life or something.

"My Mom shot herself. Hi forum, I am going through alot right now and have no idea what to do. I will tell you the story, its a long one.. I hope you are willing to read. I am 32 years old, I was very close to my mother.. We had a bond that was as strong as steel. My dad whom she was with since the age of 15 left her 11 years ago for another woman and found happiness. She had never been with any other man. I have an older sister that is 42 and we had different relationships. My mother was angry and could never get over my dad, year after year we would hear how much she hated him but still loved him, she would wish they could be one again. It never happened, she had been with no one and remained lonley for 11 years. Her depression became her life, it was so bad we would stop talking to her because all she would talk about is killing herself and how she hated my dad. 10 years of it, She had little money and was very sick, She went from healthy to brittle in a matter of 10 years. Back surgery's, aching bones, depression, pain pain and more pain. It became up to me and my sister to take care of her, she couldn't drive so we always had to drive over to take her to the dr, groceries or to get things she needed, it became stressfull and we would somtimes bicker over it..even after the divorce my dad helped when he wanted to or could. She started thinking she was a burden.. then started lashing out on us at times, I went a whole year not speaking to her until she called me to apologize for her horrible words with me. I forgave her and we began a relationship again...this time it was amazing again, we got along and finally after 10 years she accepted my partner. Long story short drama hit the fan again in early Nov this year. Things were said between her and my sister and they got me involved, I got upset with my mom and she was so hurt and thought that I thought she was a liar. My sister told me she said something about my son that she claimed she didn't. I didn't care after a while, I had plans with her on the day before thanksgiving to go see her.. on the 19th of NOV. She asked on the 19th if i could come hook up her VCR so she could watch A Christmas Story, I told her next weekend, then she later that night got upset again, she texted all of us the usual suicide talk. I had told her the day before that I didn't want anymore drama, if i went over with my family I didn't want to hear about my dad and sister. I just wanted to have a good time. She then texted me and a lot of other family that she loved me. that it wasn't my fault, she bought the gun... (I took her to get that gun for protection so I always told her if she did that I would feel to blame) She would say "" SON I bought it! Dont feel to blame"" I hated that! Still I never belived she would do it.. I was so bitter about her not wanting to be possitive I hadent called her. I ignored her suicide text and just decided to let her cool off.. 20th, 21st-29th we hadnt spoken.. I had a bad feeling but didnt know why.. she hadnt called.. so i figured she was angry with me.. I get a call from my aunt on my dads side who she was very close with.. ""Is it true? The rumors about your mom?"" I was picking up my kids from school.. I said ""huh? what she say about me this time hahaha?"" ""Call your sister"" she said.. I called and she told me to go home right away.. Then she said when getting home "" Mom... mom... *cries*... Moms dead.. she killed herself"" I said ""dont say that"" about 12 times breaking down more and more each time I repeated it.. I fell apart crying for who know how long... day one was hard, day two was harder, day 3 was numb and empty and I couldn't cry or sleep, day 4 I then hit a new horrible moment.. I found out she had been in her apartment dead since the 20th.. the complex lied and said no one heard anything and thats another story.. they are being sued soon.. her body was in there so long that we will not have an open casket this week in her funeral.. Then i went into her apartment to start gathering her things.. i smelled the death and decay.. I have never felt so sick and horrified in my life. I will never forget it.. i went to where she did it and saw the carpet cut out and her bed gone.. her place was left just like I last saw it.. it killed me.. I am now on day 6 and her ceremony is tomorrow in her home town.. Idk what to think or feel anymore.. my wife is trying to support me cause her mom died when she was 17 but i am changing.. She can see it, I dont want to run my company, I dont sleep, I have this numb feeling.. I cry out of no where.. I can not stop picturing her lifeless body, I cant stop thinking ""was she in pain?"" picturing her bleed out her exit wound for over a week.. I cry and can not stop.. I feel like dying.. I feel so empty and full of rage.. I wounder why she left me here.. I wish I could of took it back, I

"Iâm not her storage building At the beginning of the year my friend move out (her choice) and my boyfriend moved. She left some stuff behind and I would tell her to come get it all the time itâs a small apartment and there really isnât any room for me to stores her stuff here. She would just say âyea Iâll be by soonâ well a few months ago we weâre cleaning the apartment making room for a baby and told him to take her stuff to storage. Well he must have thrown her carpet cleaner away because she asked for it and we canât find it. Now she is mad and saying I did her dirty.

"Just cut off all of my friends and Iâm feeling alone and regretful Posted this to r/advice but I think that wasnât the right place for it. I just cut ties with nine people who I considered âfamilyâ for almost 10 years. Their negativity and inability to understand what Iâm working towards has literally taken a huge toll on myself. âªFriends are supppsed to support you through the good and the bad but instead I was being anchored and every time I felt I was getting out of it I was pulled back down. â¬The fact that I was so attached to them made this one of the hardest things Iâve ever had to do in my life and it took every ounce of myself to finish telling them I didnât want anything to do with them. They donât understand that in order for me to become a doctor I have to commit a lot of time to my studies. But if I canât show up to something such as drinking I get absolutely torn apart by them. Itâs like they hate when Iâm productive but they enjoy seeing me partake in stupid shit. Theyâve told me that Iâm a liar and a terrible friend on numerous occasions and itâs just too hard to even reason with them at this point. Did I over react and should I iron things out with them? Itâs just since I was so attached to them I donât know how to deal with this situation. Iâve had so many good times and years with them but lately itâs been so difficult.

"Dear reddit, i need your help I've never had a good relationship with my family. I am 15/m and always seen by everyone as overly sensitive and feminine. Kinda makes my life harder. I was recently diagnosed with depression after someone called a sub division of the Canadian child services because I was a suicide risk. Right now I'm on vacation in park city, Utahâ¦ I'm the first and only one in my family with any sort if nenral problems. I end up freaking out on the inside and my parents just tell me that this is the best part if my life and u should enjoy it. Hesri g that makes me want to kill myself more than the usual amount because I know what torture it is to be alive and if this is the best it gets what is the point. It's currently 12:32 and I'm in the basement after my brother kicked me out of my own bed. I got about 5 mins of sleep before this happened and the part that really pisses me off about it is the fact that I'm an insomniac. It's a miracle I get anything and he just wakes me up. My brother is 10. When he was 8 and 9 he would have tried to drown me multiple times and stab me once. When my diagnosis came around he's been doing everything he can to.push me towards suicide. I go to tell my friends about things that have been said to me and things that I'm feeling and their response is always dude u have a gf don't be depressed or just what the fuck is wrong with u. For the past year I've been dating around and just before coming here I got broken up with. It seems like the whole universe is against me and I just need help

"Obesity Is Killing Our Friendship Context - I'm 21 F, my friend is 24 F. Both students living alone. Obesity related health issues don't just run in her family - they've killed almost half her relatives. Six years ago, she ate fine, sure she was ""curvy"" but that was her build, her nature. She went on walks with her friends. Now she can barely make it to her front door. Her cousin - in his teens - died recently from heart failure. Weight related. Yet, she continues to put on weight, eat awful food - like taking home meat double burgers from mc donalds and then re-frying them at home, for breakfast, plus sweets, every day - and also taking energy drinks all day followed by sleeping pills at night. That is, physically, killing her according to her doctors, but there's where our issues as friends start. What's killing out friendship is her desperation - but absolute lack of effort - when it comes to loosing weight. She talks about switching back to eating the things that, when we first met, she loved - banana breakfast smoothies and chicken schnitzel. She even did a Go Fund Me for a stomach reduction surgery. Has seen more nutritionists than I knew existed. Yet whatever happens, she only eats more, or worse. She was told to stop eating pringles, and replace them with a healthy alternative like corn wafers but instead, she swapped them for deep fried pork buns. And so on. Friends have always offered to help, to buddy up, to go with. I've been on diets she ditched the first day. I've been to the gym only to have her ""go bathroom"" out the front door. Everyone else gave up. It doesn't help that her family, Fijian-Indians, seem to see food as the only way to show love. The early years, when she actually tried to diet, they'd constantly bring her fatty treats because they thought she looked too skinny. And of course, she'd eat them. And they'd bring more. I have seen her go through almost four years of pretending she'll try. I've gotten so excited and so happy and so hopeful only to have it thrown in my face. I love her, but in all honesty, I don't want to keep waiting and watching for her to die. Because that's what the diagnosis has been for the past 6 months - change her life, or die from complications. But all she does is whine about being fat, and then ask me to order in pizza. What would you do? I don't want to continue to watch her kill herself, but I can't think of anything I can possibly do to help her change.

The fucking typhoons of hate and hurt? I've lost both my brother and cousin to this....

I have picked my was off the floor a hundred fucking times.... I've had friends interupt my attempts and atm I wish they handnt because that was before botb my cousin and my brother ended it.

"I need to get this out. Feel free to ignore it.(Potential Triggers: Domestic and parental abuse, self harm, bullying, substance abuse etc. Avoiding detail AMAP) I am so sick of trying to just survive each day. I want more than anything to go out and live my life. I want a job, an apartment, a pet... but instead Iâm stuck living with my grandparents because Iâm at the point where my agoraphobia is so bad I can BARELY leave my bed. I donât think I have felt âhappyâ for more than 10 minutes at any given time in the last 6 months. I applied to try to get a tattoo to cover some scars I have from when I got really bad, but they never contacted me again...so that reminder is always there making me feel sick and myself and taunting me to do it again just to numb the crap in my head. Iâm trying to be a partner to this amazing guy I care a ton about, but I feel so emotionally shut down that I donât even react to jokes or love anymore. I donât even like when he cuddles me because his breath on my neck is a trigger... Now, I do not have it as bad as a lot of other people. I grew up in a family with a loving (OCD) grandmother, a grandfather, and a (drug addict) mother who all always made sure I had food and a place to sleep. That alone is more than a lot of people get...but every time I try to talk to someone and they donât respond to me I flip out at them because my mom didnât want me to interrupt her high. When something goes SLIGHTLY wrong or is a SMIDGE out of place I panic because thatâs all I had around me. When someone on the street spits I flinch because my exâs favourite way to degrade me was to spit in my face while mocking me. When I go downtown I get anxious because thatâs where I was publicly beating by a (different yet no les âcharmingâ) ex. I avoid drinking now because I donât want to fall into drinking to feel happy again and I definitely donât want to add to my scars...but this is all I have known my whole life. Every time I try to take a step forward, improve myself, or even leave the house to do something I once enjoyed, it feels like the weight of every circumstance and bad decision in my life is right there to push me further into the dirt. The only ways I know how to make money arenât things I want to do...the only people in my life I want to be around I canât stand to be near...I feel like I have nothing left to hold onto and Iâm drowning! Iâd check into the hospital just to get away, but unless I were to actually make an attempt on my life they wouldnât accept me (but at least we have free healthcare right?)... I just need a day of normal.....

"My wife wants another baby, I don't. Are we headed for divorce? Hi all, I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this so let me know if it's not. The title pretty much is why I'm here but let me give you some background. My wife and I dated for about a year before she got pregnant. We quickly got married and had our first girl in 2005. In 2008 we had our son, followed by our third, another girl, in 2009. We were crazy busy for a while there and things finally calmed down a few years ago. We made up for that by deciding that we should move to a nicer area. We live in Vancouver where property costs a fortune. To afford that, my wife had to go back to work full time. She had been working 3 days a week. She is a teacher so she still gets the summers, Christmas and spring break at home with the kids. She kind of half joked about having a fourth child before the move but when we moved it was clear that we couldn't afford another baby. Now we've been in our new home for about 1.5 years. The kids have made new friends, settled into their new school and sports teams. Our oldest will be heading to high school next year. Now my wife wants a new baby. She is obsessed with it. It's all she thinks about and all she talks about. She says the kids are getting older and they're not going to need her soon and she's getting depressed about it. Every couple weeks it boils over and we fight or she bursts into tears again. I don't want another baby. Our youngest is 8, our oldest is 12. I don't want to go back there. I've moved on from the baby stage and I love where we're at right now. We are crazy busy with sports and activities most of the year (hockey x2, baseball x3, swimming, art class, etc....). I am happy where we are, I don't feel like anything is missing, there's no hole in my life. If we were to have another baby, we'd have to move again. Change the kids schools again. Have the kids meet new friends again and join new sports teams again. I don't want to do that to them. I've also been carrying the financial burden for the last 12 years as my wife had finally give back to work full time. I'm not saying she wasn't working at home taking care of the kids, she was. I am saying that if we missed a mortgage payment, that was on me and it's stressful and it's nice to have some sort on that department once again. I don't really know what to do, I'm afraid we're headed for a divorce but that's the last thing I want. Should I have a baby so she won't divorce me? What if we're in the same spot eight years from now when the baby starts to grow up a bit. I asked her if she would go speak to a counselor with me but she says it won't change her mind that she wants another baby.

"Ashamed of being depressed. I've never been ""diagnosed"" with depression but I think that I'm there. Girlfriend decided she needed ""space"" so that took me down more, found a car I really wanted but after days of number crunching I decided I couldn't afford, my exiting car and house repairs keep racking up. I have few friends and live alone. Honestly I feel bad every day. I get to work an hour late and dread it, for no reason. It's not hard and I generally enjoy it while I'm there. I feel almost certain that I'm depressed, but why? I feel bad about that. I own my own house, my own car, and have no real money problems, yet I feel like shit constantly. My sister is a recovering addict. I've seen how low people can go, yet I'm not even close. I've generally been lucky and have done reasonably well for myself, yet I still feel down. No real life partner to speak of, very few friends. But I feel that being upset and down about it is wrong because so many people have it so much worse. Is that wrong? I dunno. This week has been very bad for me.

"I just love sleeping Just getting in my covers and wrap myself in a blanket. Everything's dark and my body's resting. I wish I could be there all my life. I dream, sometimes, but normally I don't dream. And that's when I'm the happiest. I just feel like I'm dead and have no problems. Just the ritual of wrapping myself and then getting comfortable is the only thing to make me smile. I then daydream, and in that state where I'm conscious but not enough to acknowledge my problems, I fall asleep. But then there comes tomorrow, and sometimes I wish I could have stayed awake all night to avoid waking up and facing reality, but then I remember I love sleeping. Sadly, it's another day and I have to get out of bed.

"I donât want to continue like this For the past few years, Iâve found it extremely difficult to talk to my mom. Some family drama happened a while back and ever since then sheâs been really tense and on edge. Almost every time we have a conversation it turns into a debate, usually ending in me sobbing and her yelling (Iâm not trying to paint myself as the victim; Iâve said some nasty things to her as well). Iâm afraid to bring up my anxiety/depression, because whenever I have in the past she rants about how therapy and medication doesnât work, there are plenty of natural remedies, yada yada yada. I just want to not start panicking every time Iâm in public! Sheâll often blow things way out of preportion to what they actually are. If my tone changes during a conversation, or I let out a heavier breath, she thinks Iâm âtalking backâ or scoffing at something she said and start yelling and threatening me. I feel like it might be paranoia, and itâs getting worse. I basically dread every interaction I have to have with her, but I would really like to have normal mother/daughter conversations, go shopping, have her help me with homework, whatever. Instead of arguing nonstop from morning till night. I just fucking hate it. Am I being dramatic? If not, what can I do to remedy the situation? If so, then it wouldnât be the first time.

"Friends keep making fun of me? Firstly, I'm 18 and attending high school right now.Recently, my parents got us a dog, and we named it Carly. I freaking loved her, but after reviewing some medical expenses we would have to pay, we had to give her back to her shelter after only a month or so of having her. I was heartbroken. I came back to school on Monday this week and told my friends. Now in my friend group of three, there is one guy who loves to make fun of us. One of my friends is fat so he makes fun of his weight. I'm gay and he makes fun of me for being a faggot. My other friend does weed and he makes fun of him for being a drug junkie. But I think he crossed the line this time. He made fun of me by saying ""you killed your dog"" and all he's been doing this week has been calling me a ""dog killer"" and telling everyone that I am one. The annoying part is my best friend in the group is tagging along with this joke and they both think it's okay to make fun of me for this. I'm kind of embarrassed to say this, but I'm a very emotional person and I suffer from depression so it's hard for me to deal with this kind of stuff. Today when they started making fun of me again for being a ""dog killer"" I left and hid in the bathroom cause I just wanted to cry and I did. I hate it when people are mean to each other and it really hurts when someone does it to me. That, and the fact I was really sad about Carly leaving me makes me just not want to talk to them anymore. But the problem is those guys are the only friends I really have (Trust me, they remind me I'd have no friends if they weren't so nice to be my friend). I really don't know what to do. I miss my dog, I've been really depressed as of recently, and my friends are making fun of me. What should I do about my friends, honestly? Because I know if I tell them ""guys stop making fun of me, I didn't kill my dog"" they'd without a doubt say something like ""that's exactly what a dog killer would say!"". I've never been able to reason with them whenever they make fun of me. Can anyone help me?

I feel like Iâve accomplished all my very serious ambitions from graduating college to studying in grad school and withdrawing, twice. (I was doing fine in grad school, they were job prep program. School Psych and a teacher prep program. I withdrew basically because I was apathetic about the job goals/mission. I studied philosophy/psychology during my undergrad and I feel extremely content with all the knowledge Iâve accumulated, but it just feels like Iâm getting old.

I feel like my role models are way too big, or that things are just downhill from here. So Iâm asking myself questions like why bother working? Why bother moving forward?

"Drank too much and ended up in the hospital Let me start this off by saying Iâm underage, so that just makes this just so much better. Anyway, a handful of months back I had the smart idea to get drunk by myself. I donât know what did it, I only drank a few shots, less than what I normally do, but whatever I guess it was destined. Next thing I know, Iâm waking up all wrapped up in IVs with my mom next to me. Iâm confused as all living hell. My mom just says âyou drank the vodka,â looking more devastated than I have ever seen her, and then I cry myself to sleep. Now Iâm ruined. Iâm broken. The guilt eats away at me all the time, constantly. As soon as I think of my family thatâs all I can think of. Apparently I was found in a aggravated state, and upon being discovered I punched two holes in the wall, along with attempting to put in a hole in my fatherâs head. God I fucking hate myself. Iâm not even a violent person, I hate hurting anything. Being anywhere around my home or family just makes me unbearably sad now. I had to come home and look my brother in the eye, and apologize for being so fucked up I tried to not only punch my dad, but a police officer who was forced to restrain me. By the way I donât remember any of this, all of this my parents told me. You know how much that hurts? Not remembering a night at all, and it turns out you ran at your dad screaming, âfuck you Iâm gonna kill youâ I hate myself. Iâm so full of regret and guilt and self hatred all the time. I hurt my family so much, and I continue to. Iâve had multiple emotional breakdowns since, when pretending to be okay just becomes too much. Iâve made my parents so concerned for me. Not only do they constantly think Iâm high now, and do not hesitate to think every single fucking broken thing is my fault because I got âtoo fucked upâ, but with the emotional rants Iâve had Iâm sure they think im about to blow any second and kill myself. I ruined everything. My relationship with my family is ruined. I love my parents beyond belief, and I know they love me too, but the shame, and the sadness I feel just being around them, itâs constantly unbearable. Nothing feels normal anymore. It hasnât since that fucking day. I would give anything, literally anything to go back. Iâd rather be completely paralyzed than do what I did to my family. I have no care for myself at all anymore. I hate myself more than any other person. Iâm selfish, impulsive, lazy, stupid, and above all less than worthless. If I wasnât born Iâm sure my family would be much more happy. I canât kill myself, because then Iâd kill my whole family. My mom straight up told me if I kill myself that will be the end for her too. I donât know what to do then. I guess slowly shrivel away or hope I get ran over.

"How I Learned About My Birthfather... &amp; My Brother? I remember when I was around 11, my little cousin, Lily, who was 6, came from Cuba to the U.S. with her parents. They stayed in our home for a few months until they were able to find a place. Right before they left for their new home; I was on my computer, I was 12, playing educational computer games. My family is chattering/gossiping in the living room per usual. I never had any interest in the family gossip, I just wanted to be in my own little space/world. Lily was not like that at all, she loved to listen-in on family drama. It was not long until Lily came barging into the room saying: ""I know a secret."" ""What?"" ""Roberto isn't your real dad."" ""Liar."" ""I'm not lying, they're talking about it!"" ""I don't believe you, so just leave me alone."" ""Just ask your mom."" After that she left the room and the seed of doubt was planted in my head. I did not think twice of it at that moment. It sure as hell bothered the hell out of me for days.. then weeks.. and eventually to months, to almost a year. It wasn't long after, I started to doubt it myself. I did not really look like my father, Roberto. He was light-medium brown skin color, I had pale skin with freckles. My mother had a light tan. Things that I did not notice before started to bother me. The difference in skin color, I did not have his last name, there were not baby pictures of him holding me. I did not feel a connection to this man. I was 13, almost 14, when I decided to confront my mom about it while she was organizing important documents. There was something about this that was bugged me was that... I KNEW the answer to her question BEFORE she could respond. I was 99.9% sure already, but I still had that 0.1% in order to fully believe it. ""Mom, can I ask you something?"" ""What?"" ""Is Roberto my real dad?"" ""No."" ""Who is?"" ""I can't talk right now, I'm busy."" It was at that moment that I knew she did not really care to talk about it. Of course, I would bring it up again and she would brush it off just the same. ""I'm busy,"" or ""Not right now."" After a while, I stopped communicating with my mother and our relationship has suffered, to this day, because of it. It was not long after my mother asked for a divorce to my step-father. I remember her sitting me down on the couch and talking to me through it. I did not have a strong relationship with Roberto to begin with, it hurt to an extent, but it was not something that I felt devastated over. She did end up telling me that she married Roberto to provide me a father figure. On my 14th birthday, Roberto tells my mother and aunt that we need to leave the house permanently. The day after my birthday, we packed up our things the same day and left. All of this happened one week before school started, I was going to start high school. It was hard for the first few months, and around that time I started to get more curious about my birthfather as Roberto was separating himself from the picture. So I began to research him, ask my mother (always backfires on me), and listening to family gossip. One of the few things I caught was that my mother came into the U.S. legally, unknowingly pregnant. When she began to go see the doctors for a check-up, that is when she found out she was pregnant. Got married to my step-father, Roberto, when I was 2yrs, and from there I believed he was my father all along up until I asked her. On April 20th, 2017 I received a random friend request on Facebook. The last name was exactly like my last name and strangely enough, looking at this guy's profile picture, he looked a lot like me -- strange. It took me a few days of speculation to finally grow the balls to accept the friend request after 6 days, April 25th. ""May I ask who you are? And do you have any relationship to Alexander?"" ""I am his son. From what I see, you're my sister."" From there he asked for my phone number. I was still skeptical and asked for details such as my birthfather's birthday and my mother's name to prove it. Once it was proven, I gave him me information. I found out I had a little brother in Cuba, he turned just 19 this year in January. My birthfather and his family were in Cuba. My brother 3Â½ yrs younger than me. It is absolutely crazy thinking how I was raised as an only child, while he was raised knowing I existed somewhere in the world. I still have trouble wrapping my head around this. I video chatted with my birthfather, Alexander, and brother, Lazaro, for hours. My father was crying. I did not get the full details on HOW they found me, it was hard to understand -- the Internet connection was extremely bad and it costs a lot of money to communicate from Cuba to the United States. I saw my grandparents for the first time. My grandfather was crying on the webcam and my grandmother was crying as well. They looked so happy and kept telling me that they prayed to God every day to just see me and that I was happy/healthy. We all laughed, we cried, we smiled. It was bittersweet. We asking questions and answering them through smiles, tears, and laughter. Unfortunately, a lot of time has passed, and that would be the first and only time I would have seen my grandmother. She died unexpectedly on December 24th, 2017. (R.I.P.

I feel like I messed up a lot of my life and the track it was going on. Now I'm just very disappointed and sad with myself. I've tried pills and therapy.

"""I used to be you"" ""It gets better"" ""You have to love yourself first"" &amp; other lies Not even sure if I should post in this sub, but.. To the people who *used to* suffer from depression, from trauma, from anxiety, from whatever made you miserable, I'm not you. You were once miserable, like me, you saw no light at the end of the tunnel, but then, you didn't give up. *Something* happened. Now you're happier, now you've got your happy ending, now you've got people who love you for who you are. But I'm not you. You probably changed, you probably were capable of change, were strong enough to change yourself even. I'm not you. I've been gone for a long time, now. There is nobody here but bad habits and terrible feelings. Sometimes I feel a semblance of someone who just wanted to make other people happy and be loved, but I think the misery just piled on like miles of permafrost. I can't blame people for not loving me, but I do blame them for lying to me. Don't they know it hurts more to say 'I care' when they don't, and it takes me much too long to figure it out? How am I ever supposed to trust people when they say they care if it's been such a common lie? The worst part is, *nobody can prove it, because nobody can help me, because nobody knows how or wants to*, I don't know. I've been asking for help for a long time now but nobody takes me seriously. You, who says that I shouldn't give up. Why? I'm not you. Years from now I will *not* be surrounded by people who love me, I will *not* be anywhere closer to happiness, I will *not* find anyone who loves me. If that person exists, and perhaps they do, I will *not* ever have the luck to meet them. You tell me I have to love myself before anyone else will. Those who grow in complete solitude don't even learn a human language. So tell me, if there is nobody to show me how to, how do you expect me to teach myself to love myself? I think you just want to place the blame on me. I don't 'love' myself and so that's why I am miserable. Not because of depression, not because of isolation, not because of poverty, not because of heartbreak, it's because I don't love myself in a world that's only taught me to hate and criticize myself. In this world where the people I thought I could perhaps give my heart to, say 'I care about you' and then show me those words are meaningless. Forgive me for being skeptical about getting better when I've only seen my life decline since it began. I'm not even asking for pity, because I know it's just the luck of the draw and I was dealt a particularly shitty hand. But can you please understand that not all of us are going to be okay in the end? Just because you suffered for many years and I've suffered for many years and you no longer suffer like you used to, doesn't mean I'm not going to continue suffering as I always have been.

"Drug addict friend!!? I have had this best friend for over 8 years now. We were childhood friends and basically grew up together. The past 2 years were a little rough because he started to drink heavily in high school. Later on he started to dabble into drugs and the âparty lifeâ. Once he started doing that, I kind of distanced myself because I didnât know how to react. I was kind of mad but also sad so I didnât really talk to him as much. Fast forward to now, I talk to him more but I donât know if it will ever be the same. He is always talking about trying new drugs and doing all this stuff at parties which tbh I donât really care for. Should I still attempt to have that relationship we once had? I still care for him but itâs so hard to listen and be there for him when heâs putting himself in dangerous situations. If I stop being friends with him, does that make me a bad friend for not sticking through it? Should I stay friends to try and make a positive environment? HELP âª

"Does anyone else straight up hate themselves? This more than anything reflects onto my own low self-worth, confidence and general view of modern day life. I really struggle seeing the positive in anything. I'm well aware this turns people away from me but even so, it's very difficult to break out of. I can't find the same lust for life that others seem to have. Everything to me basically comes down to: ""Meh, what's the point."" I don't like looking at myself in mirrors, by my own admission my personality is bland and empty and I can't really connect with people. I often wish for something bad to happen to me in my head.

"How do I reconcile with a failed friendship from the past Earlier this year, I met a Colombian woman in my state and failed at my attempts to date her; many of our disagreements surrounded my personal history of morbid obesity. Although I am 5'9'' and now weight around 240 lbs, I have weighed nearly 400 lbs as a teenager and young adult. We dined together and talked to each other for around two weeks. Within that timeframe, I became very disaffected by her constant criticisms of other men she dated, such as her issues with their hygiene, lack of direction, etc. After talking to her nearly everyday, she suddenly asked me ""Do you think we're dating?... I think we can only be friends."" I immediately parted ways with her, informed her of my thoughts on her demanding and emotionally draining ways, very bluntly told her that I didn't like her, and directed her to no longer communicate with me. After another two weeks, she texted me out of the blue and said she ""understood"" my anger, asked to reconnect saying that she though I was a ""beautiful"" person, and eventually informed me that her ""biggest concern was my weight."" After another month, we went out (with me spending money for gas, etc.) and explored multiple regions in my state. She kept encouraging me to lose weight and gave me a diet book. Within the last times we spoke, she confided in me that she was an undocumented immigrant and told me - in anguished tears - about a failed marriage here in the U.S., as well as unwanted sexual encounters she faced here. I offered my help, but she declined any of my attempts to reconcile her immigration status. After another week, I became very depressed about not meeting specific weight targets. I eventually broke down, said I felt ""less than human,"" and asked if we could postpone any further in-person meetings until I could lose enough weight. Over the weekend, she ignored my texts; I drove to her home to see if she was okay and noticed her car was parked outside. She eventually texted me, saying that I was a person with ""unfriendly attitudes"" sometimes. Later in the day, she told me that hearing me talk of my weight was tiring. I was so baffled I couldn't get out a response. After that, she told me that I am ""too sensitive,"" looked at the criticism as an insult, and then mockingly told me ""everything hurts you, everything affects you."" I told her that ignoring me was inherently wrong and hung up. She then gave me a long text ending that I should ""just be happy... happiness isn't just about body image."" I need advice on how to handle situations like this. My gut reaction was to tell her she was a ""selfish bitch"" and hang up the phone. Looking back, that's probably what I needed to do, because that's exactly what I was thinking at the time. Secondly, I need to really reevaluate a relationship with a therapist who told me that cutting her off the first time I did was the wrong thing to do. I am holding a serious grudge against him, particularly as I don't trust him anymore. In sum, I am unhappy in life - because of shit like this. I try to be a good person and deal with human turds. But I need to be strong enough to break out of it rather than be a victim.

"My grandma is dying and life doesn't stop So I work full-time and go to grad school part-time. I'm busy 7 days a week between work, class, and homework/housework. Normally this is a very good thing for me as it keeps the depression and other mental illness at bay. But my grandma's dying. She was put into hospice over the weekend and can't do much of anything anymore. I love her so much as my grandparents/mom's side of the family have been the only stable family I've ever had. My grandmother is an amazing woman. She graduated as valedictorian of her college class. She raised 7 amazing children (all college grads and successful in their fields) and has 14 grandchildren and 5 great-grandchildren. She's 90 and has lived an amazing life. It's still so hard to say goodbye. I've been doing my best to spend time with her and my visiting family but the grief and depression are kicking my ass. I can't do anything. I have a huge paper due this week and work has been insanely stressful. I can't even manage to get my laundry done and I'm buying and eating shit food that is bankrupting me. I don't know what to do. Life won't stop, and I'm so stressed that my whole body is breaking out in rashes and I'm sore all the time. I don't have any time off work since I haven't been there long and we're already short staffed. The end of the semester is coming up and I can't even think much less write a policy analysis.

It's a work out to even brush my hair. I'm physically fit, young, and given special treatment because I'm society's fit of attractive. I can't keep a job because I simply can't force my brain to do the work or I have to miss because I'm sick.. which really is just anxiety I'm sure. No one understands that I care about how lazy I seem and that it's just that I'm so tired and every thing sounds awful other than just sitting some days. I feel like I'm crazy.

"Why is it so hard to just be empathetic? Today, I failed miserably at baking a key lime pie. Filling was way too loose, meringue wouldn't whip, crust cracked, just a terrible time overall. And then my mom comes over and instead of comforting me or something a normal human being would do, says ""Better luck next time,"" with the tone of a carny trying to get a six year old away from his ring toss booth. I got even more upset, and that seemed to genuinely confuse her. All I wanted in that moment was for her to say ""I'm sorry your pie didn't turn out, it'll be okay."" Or just something a human being with emotions would say to their upset daughter. This even just kind of exemplified what I get sick of in people. Even if you don't ""get it"" why is it so hard to realize that people have different priorities from you? Especially people who are depressed or have other mental illnesses. It can be a triumph for us to get out of bed some days. If we share an achievement or (more rarely) a failure with you, be with us in that emotion for a moment. Why is that so hard for ""normal"" people? Oh yeah. Because all the empathetic people are depressed.

"Women ignore me, even here, they think I'm unworthy or too ugly to be helped. I even have the stats to prove it. Why am I so undeserving of love? I made a post yesterday today asking for help as to why I'm undatable and why no women wants to go out with me. I got 450+ views and only 6 comments, only 1 of which was from a woman. Everyone else was a male who either tried to give some advice or made fun of me. Here's proof: https://imgur.com/a/TRWg3 So if 250 women viewed my profile, only one person tried to say something. Everyone else ignored me. 1/250. 249/250 women think I'm ugly or not worthy of a relationship. Think about that. That's how unwanted I am. What if every 3 minutes, someone told you ""you're ugly, no one wants you, no one cares for you, and you will die forever alone""? That's the life I might as well live in. Let's not also forget the people that made fun of me too. I mean, what do you want me to do to get your replies, ladies? Do you want me to give you gold? Will that incentivize you to reply? The sidebar says ""A supportive space for anyone struggling with depression."" and yet people make fun of me, don't want to help, and call me ugly. I guess I'm that hopeless. Am I really a human anymore? It's human to fall in love and get into relationships and have sex and whatnot with your SO. It's human to even hookup with people. I'm not qualified to be a human apparently. I bet most people my age have had 3-4 SOs, and I've had a big fat 0. Even other people with anxiety and depression can get into relationships, when other people see them, their mental illness makes them want to care for them, but for me, they run away. It's apparent in this subreddit too. Not even worthy of being spoken to from a woman.

"Family Problems - kicked out now moving out Issue: I have found myself unable to speak to my parents about anything. I have found, when I have problems, thinking of doing something new like get a job, am sick or just news about school or just talk want to talk about everday things that I go to speak to other family members, friends, or counselors before them who I felt more comfortable with, which would then get my parents irritated, and upset and make me even less likely to talk to them about anything because of how they reacted to me. This has been going on for years Except now it has gotten a lot worse. When I have important things to tell them about, such as news about school ( be it grades, tuition, classes etc ) appointments, invitations to a friend's wedding, or pretty much anything of that sort, I leave it to the last minute. Even thinking about telling them anything makes me feel extremely nervous - my heart speeds up and there's a pressure in my chest, I tremble, get headaches . As soon as I do talk to them I panic and change the topic to ask about something else, zone out , or I can't speak clearly at all. Because of my inability to tell them anything or even socialize with them has caused us to drift far apart. I am usually one to talk and My parents dont strike up conversation with and if I somehow must up the courage to do so I feel like they don't hear me and are quick to talk of all my shortcoming. ( My mom often talk about me negatively to her friends and y other relatives sometimes where I can hear) Anyways It doesn't go well. If they start the conversation it on a bad note . I have then avoided my family even more because of how they make me feel. I merely come home from school , do my chores and homework and staying in my bedroom ad stay out of their way. I have to admit I am not a perfect child, I have given my share of attitude etc. But I believe that most of it was because I am couldn't express how I felt or wanted to say or what I was thinking and wanted to expected them to know. While I don't drugs or curse, stay out late, outright disobey the. Etc acting this is considered disrespectful to them. At first,I just assumed it was a teenage phase a little bit worse than normal but I guess normal has been ruled out since I spend longs time in the bathroom to avoid them, hiding behind doors, flinching when I am talked to or even walking around different parts of the house to pretend I am doing something among other things . I don't know why I am like this. Or how I got like this( well maybe I have some idea) but I can't shake it. I have been advised to 'just go talk to them' but that is the very thing I cannot do! I don't think they understand how much pain this causes me when I have to gather my courage to even speak to them to ask for advice, and they rebuff me even now. I need some advice about how to proceed and handle this I have no more courage in me, low self esteem and probably some other things. I feel that my parents are not emotionally ..um supportive or open.. are so judgmental and critical I just can't. I've become isolating towards friends, restless at night and start eating all the time or not much at all. There are a few events that I think really hurt me and thus contributed to the problem overtime. examples: (Younger) they threaten to bring to boarding school and my mom even brings me to tell police station to proceed with the plan. - memorable beating from incident - memorable punishment of not letting me eat for a few days because I refuse to eat a seasme seed bun ( had sensitivity too, found out after) - memorable punishment mom knnew I was extremely afriad of the dark made me sit in the dark in the living roomfor hours of the night. - I was also left at home frequently ( with no cable , no internet) and missed out on many holiday events with family and outings. I cried a lot at first but overtime I learned to occupy myself with my own company. My mom would also leave me to clean the house as well. - little ""treasured"" things like cool pencils or little toys would be taken away.i don't know why but I never asked for them back, even afterwards nor would they give them back to me. (older) - Running away to school placement - struggling to secure financial assistance from my parents to help pay for my tuition. Scared the I have to drop out. -threatening to donate all my work earnings - and kicking me out of the house with no belongings. I have been torn between leaving and staying. Especially again with being cut off from my siblings as my stepdad prevent me from interacting with them after that. I finally left after a fight with my mom last week ( which included a rule on two day noticed before going anywhere... and talk to a worker about ending my life , which resulted her call the house concerned for my safety. Mom didnt take it very well and kicked me out) I have left and i'm trying work things out with myself and try to get better which is something I cannot do at home. I am staying with a friend, and hoping to rent a room , get a job and go for counselling soon. However, They are now feeling bad me and

"I should be an actor... I feel like most people who have depression could work in theatre or movies. I don't know how you guys feel about putting on an act when really you feel so sad that it's hard to breathe, but recently I have been having to act like I am getting better from depression. My roommate confided in me one day when I came back to our dorms that he struggles with depression. He was placed in a foster home after his parents died, and his foster mom committed suicide. After that, his friend also committed suicide, so of course this takes a toll on someones' emotional health. I told him that I started taking meds and going to therapy, and I smile and laugh and act like I am doing better so that he can feel encouraged to get help with his depression. I feel so fake though, even though I am getting help, I don't think it is helping me, my chest has that particular empty feeling and breathing is hard to do. I feel like crying a lot of the times now while I am laying down in bed, and driving to and from class. I would never let my roommate know that I was actually not doing better though. I really want him to get help because I see myself in him, and he is a really good person who doesn't deserve to be sad. I wish depression never existed, it is such a sick disease.

The symptoms I experience include, but are not (at all) limited to: Emotional instability (It has not taken much to get me over the edge). Distancing myself from others. Low self-esteem. Frequent headaches. Low energy. Insomnia. Irregular eating patterns. Frequent colds and infections (within the last 30 days I've gotten 4 separate infections.

"Desperate for advice or input; I lost and am losing everything held dear to me right now due to multiple reasons, and would just like to hear some different recommendations I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO I DONT KNOW WHERE I WENT WRONG OR HOW TO FEEL BETTER!! I've typed this out way too many times so I'm gonna do my best to sum it up as short as I can: Last week me and my gf of 10 and a half months broke up, i was devestated. In that little time I have experienced more love, more of life than ever before and it felt like we'd been together forever. I thought, maybe we would work things out on our own and get back together when the time was right, even though i knew it was a stretch, but i was also okay with just being friends if that was what the world had planned. 2 days after the break up im talking to both of my best friends who are also (kinda?) friends with her, and they both tell me that she basically told them she had absolutely no intention of ever getting back with me because she wanted to ho around without the commitment of a relationship. She also openly bragged to one of them that she had cheated on me multiple times during our relationship. This all made me very angry and on top of that hurt. The same night just after finding all of this out I find out from my other friend that she had called her and bragged about hooking up with this one kid who, during our entire relationship, she told me she hated and that we BOTH already had bad history with, and fooled around. Then later (AGAIN) she goes on instagram live with my bestfriend who is kinda being fake just to see how she really is and openly brags about blocking me (which added to the hurt cause i had done nothing but try to respect her wishes since the split in hopes that we could at least part on good terms ya know) , saying that i was 'fucking crazy' and that she never wanted anything to do with me ever again. There's more in terms of details but thats the basic general idea of the past week for me. I dont know how i feel or what to say. I feel hurt and i feel abandoned and i feel stupid and i feel not good enough and i feel like a complete fuck up i feel so fucking awful its not even funny. Im losing my friends because my stupid brain cant get over this and im constantly going to them to talk about it because that's the way i like to deal with stuff, but they've heard the same thing one too many times and i get that i just dont know what else to do. Im tired of thinking about it, im tired of not being able to confront her but my friends say its not a good idea because its not gonna do anything but make her think even higher of herself for having fucked me up so badly and wont at all make her change her ways. I want to completely forget but at the same time a part of me wants to work everything out just so i can mean something to this person who meant absolutely everything to me at one point again, WHY?? Why does my brain, or heart, or whatever still crave attention from her, or maybe even her herself, even after knowing all of this? Why am i so fucking pathetic? What can I do to move on that doesn't involve just ignoring the problem and moving forward but rather coming to peace with it and myself and blossoming? Please, all and every opinion or suggestion is welcome. Thank you if you took the time to read this and I wish everybody the best of luck with your own problems no matter what they be. May peace of mind and soul find you all.

"Grandmother asks for loan to estranged father, then refuses to carry debt I'm mostly estranged from my father who has narcissistic personality disorder, lives as a squatter in the forest, and works only part-time. Meanwhile, I work in Silicon Valley. His sister made a huge effort to contact me, which I ignored for months understanding that she likely has a personality disorder as well. Eventually, I relented and agreed to meet my father for dinner over the holidays. In February, I received a call from my paternal grandmother saying my dad needs a loan because he lost his temporary job (he has regular seasonal employment) and employment-insurance benefits have recently been changed where he lives. I called my dad and he asked for a loan of $5,000. I felt sorry for the guy, so I wired him the money. After further thought, I feel this is quite a bit more than he needs to be homeless for a few months and carry his credit card payments until getting new employment. Meanwhile, my grandmother has just sold her mobile home for $60,000 and left a voicemail to tell me of this and ask if I was willing to drive down and pickup some boxes. This isn't realistic, if I did go there I would fly rather than drive for 8 hours. I called her back and asked if she would assume her son's debt. This saves me the stress of servicing the loan and I have no interest in lending money whatsoever. Since she has cash from selling her house, she is easily able to do this now. Her son can pay her back. She told me that the money from the house was needed for her retirement and that she's ""on social security."" I responded, ""I'm saving for retirement too."" (I make the full $18,500 401(k) contribution each year to avoid ending up in the forest like my dad and this in addition to paying into social security which probably won't even exist when I am 67) ""That's no way to talk to your grandmother. I'm going to hang up if you..."" at which point I hung-up the phone. My instinct her is to forget about getting the money back and just disconnect from all three: dad, grandmother, and the aunt (who I should have just ignored). Any thoughts?

"I want to be unloved so I can die without any attachments I like to drive people away. I try to be rude to my family. I get too anxious to keep up positive relationships with others, I'd rather be alone so when the time comes when I want to kill myself, I won't be held down, and I won't have anyone tying me to this world. It's hard though. It hurts me to push people away. But it's for the best. I wish I had no attachments. I wish I had no family or friends to try to connect with, I don't want them to be sad when I die. My ultimate goal in life since I was 13 was to die in peace without any attachments to the world, or leaving enough money for my family.

"How should i deal with angry best friend Hi guys so basically in the past year ever since I started dating a boy (he was my best friend for the most part in high school) my current best friend (a girl in my friendship group also from highshcool) and i have gotten into many fights . These fights are mainly about her arguing that she is no longer my number one priority and that she is just second priority to my boyfriend . I do not think this is true and they are both important to me but In very different ways - he in a romantic way and she in a friendship way. She recently came back from overseas and I organised to meet up with her and we did. I never heard from her initiating a meet up for the next few weeks or so but I finally did initiate a catch up with her after hearing nothing from her for weeks. however this plan fell through because I ended up having a work shift. Yesterday my best friend had invited me to catch up with her before she went to work (she had work at 1pm)and I messaged her asking if we could hang out until 12pm. She asked me why I couldnât stay until 1 with her till she had to go to work and I explained itâs bevause I had invited my boyfriend over for lunch and movies at my house (this catch up with my boyfriend was meant to be another day but got postponed to the same day as my catchup with my best friend due to him getting sick). She got very angry and told me she now does not want to see me at all and cancelled the catchup because she said she felt second priority. She said She shouldnât have to change her plans for my boyfriend who I see so much more compared to her (I would love to see her more but she never plans anything with me or when I do ask her when sheâs free she always has family plans ?) She also brought up the previous weeks events of me cancelling our plans due to me having work and got angry with me for never trying to find another day to make up for these cancelled plans I tried explaining to her how important she is to me and how I donât see her as second priority or never meant to make her feel like second priority but she is giving me silent treatment or being passive aggressive . I am tired of having to prove to her that she is important to me and I am tired of this drama . My boyfriend is so wonderful and he is always there for me and replies to me instantly and we share many things on a personal level (emotionally physically etc) so to me it seems natural that I will try and adjust my plans to try and accommodate him - as he does so much for me that nobody else does, not even my best friend. so I donât understand why she expects to be higher in priority than my bf and isnât happy with being the same priority as him? I am tired and confused. Donât know how to respond to her passive and blunt messages to me after I tried apologising and explaining Please help

"I really need some advice *trigger warning* *trigger warning* Hi everyone. I'm sorry if I'm doing this wrong. This is my first time visiting this subreddit, and so I don't know what's generally expected or done on here. Let me just get into this. I'm 22 and I've never experienced depression. I'm a Psychology major and I've taken classes over the topic, but I know reading about it can only give me so much insight. The reason I'm posting on here is because I have a 12 year old cousin who tried cutting herself the other day. She's depressed, says she wants to die, and I am so, so worried about her. She lives a few hours from me and is being watched closely right now, but I plan on going out to visit her this weekend. To be honest, she has a horrible living situation. My aunt (her mom) is awful. To my aunt, every problem can be solved by God, she's financially fucked and letting it out on my cousins, and she's extremely dismissive of my cousins feelings, needs, and emotions. It also doesn't help that my cousin is adopted, and I know she just feels detached from her own family. Anyways, I know that there's no such thing as simply getting your advice on how to fix my cousins depression. I know how complex of an issue this is. What I want to know from you all is if there is anything I can do this weekend to just show her that things can get better. My little cousin has always looked up to me, and I plan on taking her out to do some of the things that she always wants to do (like go to the park, make slime, whatever 12 year olds like). But is there anything extra I can do? Is there anything that you all wish someone told you? Or maybe even something you wish they didn't? I would really appreciate any tips or advice you all have for me this weekend. I know my cousin has a very long road ahead of her, but I want to do anything I can to make it easier. Thank you. tl;dr my 12 year old cousin is depressed and attempting to hurt herself. I'm going to visit her this weekend. Is there anything I can do (or shouldn't do), that might at least show her that things can get better.

The issue that really concern me at the moment is child labor. I hate to see children working to earn money and live in poverty when they are supposed to learn and enjoy their childhood. Another dream of mine is to pursue in the post graduate program after finish my degree. That is very difficult for me as I need a good GPA to get the financial loan. I think I didnt do well in my study at the moment. I dont think I am able to continue my study in master program. I always hate myself because I feel like I lack a lot of thing. I have a social anxiety where I love being alone, I feel nervous when talking with someone else. I avoided my highschool friends because I think I cant fit well. I am afraid to talk in front of the crowd, I am not able to express myself well. I hate that I am incapable to defend myself sometimes. I feel self loathing. I wake up every morning feeling the same thing, feel I will never accomplish anything. I see some of my friends are married, have their own cars and good jobs. I am stuck here and doing nothing. I cant be pretty like them and I dont have money. That is it my life.

"I just drove 1000 miles cause my Gma tried to OD and is in ICU. IDK if this belongs here. Maybe it will get removed, but I feel like I need to vent somewhere. My grandma has struggled with manic depression a lot through her life. I've always seen her as this strong independent woman. She has always been my favorite family member because just how kind and loving she is toward everyone and everything. No matter how bad life has ever gotten for me or anyone else she has always had positive words. Well I never knew it but she's a bottler and my dad told me in the 90s she snapped and try to OD roughly 20 years ago. Combination with anxiety and stress and lots of other factors. Keep in mind everyone loves this woman she has 3 granddaughters and 1 grandson and loving kids. This woman is a saint in my family. He we are 20 years later again. My family and I live in Texas, meanwhile they live in Georgia and my dads sister/ gmas daughter and her family live in Virgina. My aunt plans to move back to TX. So my grandparents were planning to move to TX since everyone on the East Coast is leaving. When it came down to sign on a Realtor she snapped I guess again.... These are people in there 70s trying to uproot their life again and move across country. She tried to OD on some pills and my dad, sister, and I hopped in the car yesterday and drove from Tx to Ga. My Gpa said he noticed she was eating less but didn't see the signs. Now we surprised her and didn't tell her we were coming. Amongst other family all were happy to see us. My Gma I could tell wasn't the rock solid woman I always known her to be. It made me realize that you can be 70yo and still have these dark thoughts and try. She looked so weak and frail. So here I am in a different time zone trying to support my gma the best I can. My sister doesn't even know, she just thinks she's 'sick'. This woman has all the love in the world and that still doesn't help dark thoughts. IDK how I feel, I don't know how I'm coping. It hasn't hit me yet I think... Also my Gpa literally would not survive without her. Like she's the one that makes sure bills are paid on time and basically runs the house. She's his guide and he'd be lost and a wreck without her. Hes so shaken up and worried. On top of everything my girlfriend just tried the same thing but a different method and her brother called the cops and she got 5150'd and I've talked her once in 3 days. When she called I had just learned about my gma and I feel like she didn't get the support she needed from me. It breaks my soul to think that this loving amazing person would want it to go all away and leave all of us behind. I have so many cherished memories of my grandparents. Sometimes I feel like I can get these stints of depression and I know it runs in the family. So here's me unbottling to you guys in hopes to here thoughts, prayers, and reddit love.

"A letter to â¦ my sister, who has conquered her depression The letter you always wanted to write... Family stuff happened and those wounds in you festered and festered. No one knew at the beginning. You hid it well under your sleeves and at the back of your eyes. Before it all happened, I sometimes looked at you and thought that this would happen to you. It is the way you used to hold your emotion. It is as if you were full to the brim with it, but you forced it down, shoved it into a box and hid it away. It was strange, but I was too young to understand. And then, slowly but surely, it took you over. You were so young. In my worst nightmares I imagined finding your lifeless body. I couldnât wake you up. You wouldnât wake up. My darling sister, even now I still imagine your cold body. How can such a deathly and frightening disease exist? You wasted away. Your cheeks were concave, and you didnât even have to bend over for every bone of your spine to be visible. Your sharp wit and intelligent mind dulled. Your eyes were dark holes in your face. They were so empty. You slept all afternoon and night. I would lay my cardigan over you so you wouldnât get cold. But I donât think it made a difference. You were lost to us, floating in some different universe with no anchor or thread holding you to us. And then you tried to end it all. Multiple times. When I think about it, I blame you sometimes. But I know that the blame is not really towards you. It is towards me, of course. I am your sister. I should have been your protector. Is it OK if I say that I couldnât really do anything but stand there and watch it run its course? Or is that just an excuse? You are my best friend, even though I am not always yours. I wish I would be kinder to you, but I probably will always hold some of myself away. Maybe I am punishing myself. I donât know. No one can say it didnât take a toll on all of us. You probably donât remember, but we were going to the corner shop together once. As we chatted, you were vehement that you were a failure. I asked you, what on earth were you a failure at? What life had you lived that you possibly could have failed? And you said: âI failed at life.â So what was the alternative, my dear? Death? Iâm telling you, I lived those few years in the fear that you would be taken away from us by your own hand. Even as I am writing this, I donât know where to start or end. In my mind, it is such a mess. It doesnât matter because you are well now. I have never seen someone work harder. You are radiant and beautiful and clever and sarcastic and so special I couldnât tell you how much if I tried. I hope you will always appreciate the battles you have fought and won. I hope you always believe you are a success. I wish you all the happiness you deserve. Love you, babe. Your sister

"Doctor taking me off meds Cold Turkey Hi everyone, I've been on Prozac (Fluexetine) since 9th grade. I am a 2nd year student in college now. For the past few years I've been upped from 10mg, to 20mg, and now 40mg. I've been on 40 mg for 3 years. When I went to my doctor it was only to tell him during a check up that I was comfortable with my medicine and dosage, so he would send more prescriptions to my pharmacy. During my last visit, I expected it to be a quick and simple check up as usual, but instead he said he was prescribing me ""3 more months"" of 40 mg Prozac then making me stop cold Turkey because ""being on Prozac for more than 6 months is bad"". I don't understand because he has been constantly renewing my prescription for years and never said anything about tapering off or stopping. I once went a month cold turkey during a health insurance issue and around the 3rd week I had attempted suicide. And addressing the ""3 months"" he promised, I was quickly informed the pharmacy was only given 1 month of medicine for me I've been admitted to a mental hospital by my mother after I got raped and beaten, because I drank a lot of alcohol for a few days. I've been to several therapists. I've been rationing my pills 1 every 2 days, and my mother and fiancÃ©e who I live with have already seen a drastic change in my behavior. I feel awful because they give me such a nice and comfortable life but I am still depressed. I don't know what to do when I have no more antidepressants after 5+ years and then going cold Turkey. I'm afraid my brain chemistry will convince me to do something stupid and damaging to myself again.

"I had a date on Saturday. It went great unfortunately. I have a friend that I'll call H. I've known her for 2+ years now and I really like her as a person. I recently discovered that she was interested in dating me, which boosted my self confidence so much (because who would be into someone like me). Well a week ago I worked up the courage to ask her out on a date, and this Saturday we went on one. It was great. We went to a small local coffee shop and sat there and just talked for almost 3 hours. It was seriously such a good time. On the way out I asked if she'd like to do it again and she said yes. Awesome! Later that night I get a text... she doesn't think it will work out in the long run. I ask her why and she says we both have very different plans with our future, she's still getting over another break up, etc... Well that sucks, but I understand. I was texting H about it a bit more tonight and this is what I get in reply to how I feel about the whole situation- ""i feel like there were so many expectations from others that it was made into something i thought i wanted, but then i realized it wasnât."" That attraction she had to me? It wasn't real. It was all made up because of her friends. And of course it was, because who would be into someone like me? It hurts so bad. I'm crying while typing this. I feel like such an idiot for believing someone would actually be attracted to me. I'm a fool for believing it and I hate myself for it. I don't know what to do. I thought maybe it would help posting here or something. I don't know.

I then said I walk the dogs as well, I just don't do it enough because I'm the only one in the family who works from morning to night, paying for the bills, groceries and everything. He then claimed that it's not his fault and then started saying how if someone told him to look after their child and he accidently killed it, would it be his fault. I responded with yes, it is your fault because it's under your duty of care. Anyway, things got ugly from there. I didn't speak to him for a week. He got my sister to ask me to pay for his bills and fines. I paid for the $500 one today this morning. Then he asked to borrow my car, and I lent it to him. After that, he came back and started throwing passive jabs at me by talking to the dog. e.g. ""Bailey, you're lucky that I'm here. If i wasn't here, you would've died a long time ago. Some people just know how to talk and don't do shit."" I got annoyed and said you lost the dog. Get over it. He then yelled at me. I got annoyed and told him to fuck off. He then started saying ""wow, you're being so disrespectful. God will punish you. I wish you die and I wish you'll live out your life alone."" I then said ""You came home and started a fight for no reason. Don't play the victim when I argue back"". He then said ""I'm just talking to myself. You don't have to listen to me."" I then said ""Go talk to the wall then."" I shut the door and continue with my business. He then walked next to my door and started going on and on about how I'll die soon for being disrespectful and that god will send a lightning bolt to hit me. I then angrily snapped at him saying ""I may or may not die before you, but I can bet that if you die, no one in this fucking world would mourn for you"". I then shut the door, and I didn't hear anything from him again. Not sure if I have a abusive father or I'm just toxic or maybe it's both. I don't want to live like this anymore.

"My mother pt.2 I posted about my issues with my mother the other day, and I have discovered new information. She's been complaining to her boyfriend, and he has a busy mouth, so naturally he's spilled it all. I've learned that my mother never wanted me to move back in with her after I lost my apartment, and she's been saying she buys me lots of things: clothes, computers, etc. And I just toss them aside and never use them, because I'm an ungrateful child. So she just took the stuff and started wearing the clothes. None of that is true. What's probably going on here is that she's buying herself things, and using me as a scapegoat so she doesn't have to tell her boyfriend she has money, or bought things for herself. Or she's just delusional and making shit up. Maybe even that she's stealing clothes from me and covering that way. I could believe any of that. Either way, she wants me to leave, and I know she does. And that hurts like a mother. No pun intended. What I want to do is get custody of my younger brother, and leave the state. Just start over, and make sure my brother is raised in a safe and nurturing environment. Because I can't live with knowing that he's growing up in the same toxicity that I did, and how it'll fuck him up like it did me. She's two-facing everyone; talking shit to one person, then smiling to the person's face she just trashed. And if anyone tries to call her out, she gets pissed and plays dumb. Her sugar daddies have been showing up at the house. She does drugs on the daily. She's going to end up old, a lone, and with her kids and family hating her, no one coming to see her. I'm ready to disown her. It just hurts. Why is she like this? Why does it have to be this way? It hurts.

"Cheap gifts on the Receiver's side My friend and I are friends for about 5 years. We ended up going to different colleges, but kept in contact online. I think of them as my best friend, but i'm not sure if it is reciprocated. Every year I stress about giving a good gift for their birthday and xmas. A gift too expensive makes them feel uncomfortable by setting expectations. A gift too cheap devalues our friendship and being on the receiving end feels terrible. I purchased their birthday gift is about $12 (Lush soap), and the Christmas gift is about $8-10 (sweets). The price of the cards are not included. They got me a small notepad that looked like it came from the dollar store for my birthday, and a couple stickers for Xmas. There was no card included or even a piece of paper that had my name on it. Last year they got me a $15 gift with the receipt for my birthday. My gifts were around the same value (~$15). I try not to place too much importance on the price tag, since it is the thought that counts, but their gift to me is really cheap (~$1-2), and looked like it was slapped together an hour before we met. I know they can afford to buy a gift. They buy coffee every couple days and bought lunch to the point where the staff remembered their order. I accepted their gift, but it was really hard to avoid showing my disappointment. I honestly thought it would of been better if they just didn't give me a gift at all. Is this a sign? Are they trying to tell me something or do they really think of me so little? I'm not sure what they are thinking or what should I do. I know giving them a similarly cheap gift is an option, but I would rather know why they thought to give me this gift. I could also brush this off as a one time thing, but I think that this is not the case.

"Zoloft made me fly off the handle I have episodes of clinical depression that last a few weeks alternating with episodes of being euphoric, having so much energy, and thinking I am the greatest person in the world and I have superpowers. Itâs awesome but has issues of its own because I tend to make poor choices, act conceited/rude without realizing it, and sometimes get angry. I was on Zoloft for a short time (age 11-12) and it made me a little less depressed but caused me to do horrible things impulsively, act spoiled and stuck up, and have frequent fits of rage. I attempted suicide within the first month of taking meds. I developed anorexia, made poor sexual and financial decisions, and was fired from my Saturday job as a babysitter because I was yelling at the kids, teaching them how to swear and bragging about it to other teachers, and trying to flirt with the childrenâs fathers. At school I told everyone I had superpowers and raged at them when they said that my superpowers were not real. I had arguments with my parents and pulled out a knife to threaten them at one point. I had a boyfriend but was still flirting with other boys constantly including my teachers. I tried to ârapebaitâ by going into the house of a suspected molester/murderer/drug dealer but was stopped thankfully. After going off meds I crashed and burned HARD. Iâm better now however as this was 5 years ago. I cringe whenever I remember it however.

So ignoring the pun, I seriously have no interests in what carreer I want when I'm older (im 17, kicked out of collage) I don't know if this is he depression but after working overtime on my shitty Saturday job I have had 5days work in a row and without sounding like a lazy cunt who has never worked. I genuinely have never been so fucking depressed, all I have done is wake up at 8. Work all day, not said a word to anyone been depressed all day, got in, all my mates are out enjoying summer and don't speak to me or anything. I usually get in at about 6pm I eat tea then shower then do nothing for a few hours until I go to bed and repeat. Without sounding too dramatic, I can't do this for the rest of my life. I don't want to work. I know you have to but why? I don't want to do something I don't want to do, I don't understand why the world is this way and it makes me super fucking depressed. I have no hobbies and I just feel like pure shit.

"I want to fix my best friend and I's friendship, but I'm not sure if I should... any advice? Hi! I'll try to make this as short as possible, but you can ask me for more details if you want to. My best friend (19/f) and I (19/f) met two years ago. We're polar opposites, but we somehow became very close, and eventually started calling each other best friends (and other nicknames haha). It was awesome, and she's the only person I feel that close with -- she's like family (though I never told her that). Back in July though, I was feeling very drained. My best friend deals with severe depression and I was helping her a lot through it, willingly so. Honestly I felt fine for a year but I've been going through a huge identity crisis, trying to find myself and trying to know myself. I felt so confused and lost with myself -- I didn't know what I wanted anymore. It was bad. It was very exhausting for me mentally but I thought the cause of how I felt was my best friend. You might ask why I thought that, well, whenever we'd hang out, I'd have to go out of my house. I'm an introvert, and I deal with a lot of anxiety, I always feel uncomfortable being outside. But considering I'd only go outside to hang out with my best friend, I thought *she* was the problem. I took me a while but I eventually decided, even though I didn't really want to, to end the friendship. I thought this would make me feel better, like it was the key to my happiness or something. After I overcame the ugly crying phase that lasted for a week after I ended the friendship, I was feeling really good... for only a week. It was a sense of freedom like ""I don't have to worry about anything anymore!!"". I started missing her real bad though. But I thought, hey, maybe I just miss the IDEA of her, and not really HER. So I waited to see if my feelings would change over time. Back in september, uni started. We shared the same classes. We saw each other again and I thought it was a good opportunity to talk to her again and explain some things out, and especially apologize to her (we had a bad argument when I told her I was ending the friendship), and she apologized too. She was really excited because some of her guy friends were with her at uni and she wanted me to hang out with them. I was still questioning a lot of things about myself at this point, and I was terribly anxious about starting uni, and also because I was scared her friends wouldn't like me or think I'm too ""innocent"" or whatever. So I chickened out and decided to avoid her. Two days later, I dropped out of uni (not because of her), and didn't say a word. I was feeling ashamed about dropping out and I had issues at home that made me feel really depressed, so I isolated myself BAD. I pushed all of my friends away, and eventually ended up alone, well, I still had some internet friends, but they didn't last long because I ended up ignoring everyone's messages. Fast forward to now. I still miss my best friend terribly. Some days are worse than others. I thought I'd be over it by now but I always end up crying at night because I just want to talk to her and hang out like we used to. I tried to distract myself as much as I could, and I tried to make new friends, but every time, I ended up realizing that I was just trying to find someone to replace her, which obviously didn't work out. I realized that I talk about her everyday still to my parents. My mom actually asked me how she was doing and I had to remind her that we're no longer best friends. I still think very fondly of my best friend so when I talk about her, or think about her, it's like nothing happened. I dream about her too sometimes. I want to contact her again. I want to explain to her everything I was feeling and tell her I want us to be friends again. But I'm scared. It looks like she's completely moved on from me, and she has this new (guy) friend and they seem really close. It makes me sad because I feel like I've been replaced and I won't be able to be her best friend again. I want to be here for her, laugh with her, cry with her, hang out with her, be by her side during the best and worst moments. I don't want to be with anyone else. Just her. I can't blame her for finding new friends and moving on, also her new friend seems like a really great guy, I actually think I'd get along with him. But I don't know, it still makes me feel sad. It makes me feel like I shouldn't contact her because she doesn't need me in her life anymore and she forgot about me. I'm aware this is probably the case though. I've been thinking of making an audio where I just talk about what's on my mind and talk about our friendship and send it to her. I'm so scared though. Is this a good idea or should I just drop it? It really makes me feel sad and I'm crying way too much over this -- I feel like, even if we can't be friends again, I need some closure. I didn't tell her everything when I ended the friendship, I only told her something like ""we don't click anymore"", I'm not even sure because it was a lie. I didn't want to hurt her feelings by saying her

Iâm ugly as hell, my face can be described as if Satan sneered his shit on the earth, Iâm probably stupid, and everyone I know would be better off without me.

"Does anyone else ""live inside their head""? Hi, this is my first ever post. I feel like I'm living in my head 99% of the time. I catch myself forming conversations in my head between me and other people. It's pretty obvious because my lips move and I tend to smile when this happens. (A couple of my friends have pointed this out) Sometimes, the conversations are just between me and myself. I feel very numb during this whole process. The topic of these ""conversations"" revolve around feeling worthless in every aspect. It feels like life is against me. I'm average in every way (looks, intelligence, skills). I feel like I will never amount to anything. I just do things to get them over with, just so that I can continue to keep to myself and get stuck in my head like this. I don't have pride in any non-school/school project or assignment I do. Even things that should be enjoyable, like going out with friends doesn't really do anything for me. It feels as if nothing brings me joy, except numbing myself out from everyone else.

"Tipped off by someone that best friend is not okay It's been a semester in college and people here are very interesting. Recently, I [F] made a best friend Theo* [M] in class. We're both in the same major, speak the same native language, and he always helps me understand the homework (he's smarter than me), meaning that we spend about 2 hours/day together, if not more. We got super close within a few weeks, and I started to develop a crush on him. But I have a boyfriend (long-distance), and my feelings for Theo were not sexual, so I resolved to think of Theo as just an older brother - it hasn't been a problem for a few weeks now. We still hang out as best friends. My primary means of communication with him is facebook in our native language. A week before, he added me on snapchat, but we never talk on it. The other day, I got a snap with a mispelling of my name, to which I sent a question mark. The day after, I got a snap from a girl Lucy* claiming to be Theo's boyfriend, who told me she got my username from Theo. She told me that he was acting weird, and for my name w/mispelling, to look out for him since they were also long distance. I don't know how to approach the situation. I want to make sure that Theo is okay, since I did have some problems with suicidal/bored/lonely friends before. But he never told me that he has a girlfriend or about Lucy, and when I took to other forms of social media to find her, I couldn't find her - she wasn't in any tagged photos of Theo either. I may be completely over thinking, but I also think that Lucy has ascess to Theo's snap, which is how she got to me - meaning that I'm not sure if Theo knows that I know Lucy. If she has ascess to the snap, she could also have acess to his facebook (although I'm pretty sure she can't speak our native language).... Basically, I'm not sure how to approach him to ask if he's okay okay. I always ask how his day was, and it ranges from okay to sleepy. So if I ask if he's okay, he might ask me why I thought he wasn't okay, and I don't think I can say his girlfriend was wondering - we don't talk about relationship stuff, I don't think he know I have a boyfriend, although this is posted all over my social media. Going down a rabbit hole - please help!

"I have a bad personality that appears good. My personality is a result of childhood abuse and depression. I was treated like a subordinate not worthy of shit growing up and now as an adult I'm a people pleaser to the extent of ruining my own life to help others even if they dont need it because I worry about my reputation and want people to constantly think I'm a really good person. I know that it isn't good behaviour but I don't know how to be outside of that. It feels nice to get praised for it but I really want to start accomplishing things for myself and let people handle their own business. I want to be someone. I don't even feel like a person half the time. There are too many ways to be and I don't know which one is a good fit for me. It's definitely not this. I'm not really sure what to do and I'm sure no one could really answer this for me but I really wanted to get it off my chest. Idk if anyone else is like this but it sucks. I was doing some research and found martyr syndrome and it really kicked me off my pedalstool and I feel like a piece of shit that sets too high standards and takes too much responsibility on and makes people feel bad. I thought I was just a super nice person but I'm actually an asshole victimizing myself constantly and blaming it on others. TL;DR: I have a bad personality and I want to find a new one that is better.

"How to Make Friends When No One Likes You A little background, in 4th grade my teacher would encourage bullying me (she got fired the end of the year) and I pretty much grew up taught it was okay to be bullied, so I never learned to stand for myself. That obviously left a lot of scars, and my depression (diagnosed in 7th grade) makes me isolate myself a lot. I don't want to sound like I'm looking for sympathy, and sorry if I am. But now I have mere months left in the school year of my senior year and I still have absolutely no friends. I am friendly and I try to be as outgoing as I can, it feels like everyone is keeping me at an arm's distance though. Is it me? It must be, I don't know why but something about me just makes others hate me. I'll ask how someone's day is going and often the reply is just a short ""pretty good"" and then that's it. I refuse to beg for friendship or to force anyone to talk to me so when they walk away or leave I'll just accept it, wave and say ""see ya around"" or etc. How do I get people to be my friend though? I don't smell, I am ugly but I try to cover that up best I can with makeup. I just want to feel like I belong somewhere with someone.

"Describe your depression Here is how I would describe mine: I live an exceptionally fortunate life. I am a college student interning for a commercial real estate development company. I had two internships last summer, one in venture capitalism and one teaching middle schoolers how to code. I have a potential internship lined up for a Fortune 500 company in Miami next summer and potentially an private equity internship lined up. I have all the networks and connections in the world to be successful. But I feel so unhappy and miserable with my life. My thoughts are so irrational and negative that I can't see how fortunate I am to have all that I have. I make great money with my summer internship, more money then most adults make, but none of that matters, because I still have suicdial thoughts almost everyday. I feel hopeless all day, everyday. I feel unloved and unwanted. Even though I have more than enough to be grateful for, I still feel inferior and lower than the lowest of the low.

"IDK WHAT TO DO ANYMORE AH IM IN SUCH A DILEMMA. Basically I have this friend whom Iâve known for 10+ years and weâve always been quite different but were good friends nonetheless. Over the past 3 years this friends true colours have been slowly creeping out and its been really affecting me! Most recently she did some that was way out of line and really made me question who she is! Iâve tried cutting her out slowly and distancing myself but I canât really escape it since our university campuses are the same and sheâs recently joined a club Iâm in! Sheâs basically just so fake around me and is so nice to everyone else and I ignore it and let it slide but the thing she did that was way out of line is something I canât get over? She also always makes me feel guilty for what I have and always makes me out to be just âluckyâ but nothing I have âhaveâ is due to luck! Itâs literally pure hard work??? And now that sheâs joining this club itâs gonna make things 1000x worse because sheâs just going to show off to all the guys and be this super fake ass person? She thinks she can get away with it and basically try walk all over me just because sheâs known me for ages cause otherwise she literally follows everyone else like a sheep? Iâve tried confronting her about her actions but she just laughs it off??? How can I just get over it all ready?? Itâs really beginning to affect my mental health ð­ like I didnât really speak either her over the last 2 months and Iâve never been happier but seeing her around college more literally makes my blood boil sheâs honestly just so toxic and I feel like hanging with her in this club is going to ruin my reputation and what others think of me!

"Not good enough. Greetings, everyone. I am currently in need of venting my thoughts. Reddit seems like the perfect environment for fucked up people, like myself. I've come for the wisdom and maybe even the charming assholes. So, here's the scoop: Growing up, I was always compared to a specific relative. I won't say which, because I'm a paranoid fucker. But we shared the same gender, were of similar ages, and were always very different from each other. Still, we were extremely close. The biggest difference was our weight. Yes, I was always the ""larger"" one. People enjoyed to point it out, but what really stung was that our own family would as well. Fast forward to years later, when we were in our teenage years. It became so much more than our weight. Our family started comparing our physical appearances. They were always the more ""attractive"" one. The more ""successful"" one. We are both adults now. Our grandmother speaks wonders of this person, and only has negative things to say about me. Despite all of this, I was always deemed the ""nicer"" one. That hasn't mattered a single bit. I constantly beat myself for picking up the phone when our grandmother calls, because I give her personal details of my life only for her to turn around and use it as juicy gossip material. She is very sick, and I assume quite close to death. I pick up because I feel massive guilt when I ignore her calls, while my ever-so-""better"" relative ignores them with no problem, and is still worshipped. I've considered cutting ties with my entire family. I don't believe they genuinely care about me. Yeah, I'm struggling. Bad. I'm basically at rock bottom right now. Still, I highly doubt my wellbeing is in their best interest at all. I don't think I'll ever be the picture perfect grandchild, child, sibling, whatever. It drowns me deep in self-loathing every day.

"Trying to start a dialogue with a friend and seeing it blow up in my face Hi Everyone, First off, thank you to everyone here. I've been a long time reader but never posted. This is yet another post regarding a friend and the problems associated. Basically, me and this guy have been friends since college, we're both in our mid-30s and entering into the next phase of our respective lives. We've always had a contentious friendship, many fights, many core disagreements, and often general dislike for one another. The solution to dealing with this has always been along the line of this: it's R, and he's an asshole, so what can you expect! So the story in question goes like this... we're at a mutual friends wedding and he goes out of his way to ignore me and my gf, now my fiance, coming over to the group we were with and asking a question to a couple people then leaving, also practically walking by us without saying hi. It was only until I said something that he acknowledged us, which set my fiance up in flames. A few weeks later we got engaged and I texted all my friends, including R, individually with a semi copied/pasted message. It was short and sweet, but 100% honest. He doesn't reply, I left the country for vacation, and I never got his text. Turns out he did reply but more on that in a minute. I was upset, I sent him an email that was part deconstructive to our friendship, partly selfish, but also completely honest. I told him my feelings, how I contemplated why he didn't respond but ultimately decided that i didn't care and that I didn't need someone in my life who was going to treat me that way. By telling him these were my feelings and repeating that I wanted him to realize I was upset and I wanted to open a discussion. I never said directly ""I don't want you as a friend"" or ""you're not invited to my wedding"" but that is what he took from it. I wanted to open a dialogue, but he got really upset and angry. Also turns out he did respond to my text, a week later and said that the original text never sent, but that since his wife is pregnant he wouldn't be able to make the wedding, which is completely fine with me because the wedding is in another country. I just hated his response, it was cold and not something a friend should send to another friend regarding a wedding. I called him out and wanted to make him see that by my standards he was not acting like a friend, but also neither was I. I had not put much effort into the friendship either. But I did say that I wanted to say these things rather than say nothing with the hopes that we could find common ground and build a foundation for something to grow in the future, which he completely ignored. I honestly have no idea what to do. I fear he is going to turn all our mutual friends against me, and I don't know how I am able to handle that, or if I can even handle that. My life is in a great place, but my friendships are shit, and that hurts more than I could ever imagine. To put more on top of it, his wife was having issues with a pregnancy, which he said were serious. But I heard from a mutual friend that he said she was fine. So I don't know how to react to that. I honestly don't know where to go from here. My fiance, my rock, my saving grace, is unfortunately traveling for work this month and really crazy busy. She owns her own business so it's important for her to pound the pavement and get sales, so I really don't want her to be burdened by my own bullshit. I can send anyone the email discussion in a PDF if you want to read it. Hopefully someone can help.

"Gossiping in the family Hello. I am not sure whether this fits in this sub but I am going to ask it anyway. My family is a known gossiper. All of them tend to gossip about me. I am the odd ball, the one who doesn't agree with them. The one they all tend to chat about. Many times we have arguments, they all gain up on me. I will have my mom, dad, and older sisters all attacking my character- telling me I am no good and that I am poison . I have caught them in a few instances; but they brush it off. Often, they pretend I am being paranoid or they play dumb and be like, ""I did nothing, we said nothing."" Sometimes they complain about someone else to use it to get to me. It's really bothersome. It makes me feel so betrayed, confused, and really angered. I also not my family learns things about me before I even told them- mainly negative. There are lists of inconsistent gaps. I try to confront them but they immediately dismiss me. They try to cover up their tracks and always tell me I am paranoid. I know lots of the advice will be to confront them, but I do not believe that will work. I have tried that- all kinds of approaches but they insist they did nothing even when I catch them saying things about me. My mother does it the most. Often she, gossips after work with my sisters or sometimes with my dad. Sometimes my sisters gossip about me together. I have become the play thing in the family- my problems and life is just a giant joke they can share their contempt for. It's hurts. It's hard not to give a shot because it's your own family. I have considered audio recording secretly but that is creepy and invades their privacy despite they do that with me often. It's also wrong to play the same game. What should I do? I really am at a loss.

"Ever Feel FB ""Friends"" Are Lying Out Their Asses? For real. How the fuck can people post about life being great, life is so good, and being blessed? It's like they want to rub your nose in it how wonderful their life is. While you're wallowing in alcohol/drugs, in a room by yourself, contemplating suicide. Sometimes, I just want to call people out on this bullshit but I don't post on FB anymore. No possible way these people are that happy and enjoy life so much. Is it just narcissists?

"Post-Graduation Depression I recently graduated from college, and over the past couple of months Iâve grown increasingly depressed. I feel this profound sense of loss and it feels as if the color has drained from the world. Whatâs shocking to me is that I honestly hated college - I was either working or studying 24x7. I rarely had a single moment for myself or friends and was constantly exhausted and anxious. Now, I have a great job, live with my girlfriend, have almost no debt (thanks to working so much in college), and live in my ideal area. My life is comparatively so much better, but I feel this knot in my stomach as if I just finished a good book or beat the story of a video game and now Iâm finally seeing how much of myself Iâve given up to get to where I am. Life feels devoid of adventure and I feel like I have no passion left. Iâve struggled with depression for a long time, but itâs weird to have it catch up with me at the point in my life where past sacrifices were meant to mitigate it.

My best friend used to always be there for me, he was the barnyard kind of personality, with tonnes of love and compassion for everyone around him, and along him was excitement and exploration. We used to explore the woods together and sometimes sit and stare at the campfire for hours until we fell asleep together. His name was Archer, he was my cat, and he was my best friend. A woodland animal killed him, he was defenseless.. I've tried with different cats to fill the empty void, but they were never aware of me. Archer was always where I was, and were going. I cry every time I lay down in bed, look to my side and expect a short purr and a hop to my lap.. now there's nothing.

"Friend emotionally unloads on me? I have a particular friend from highschool who always wants to meet up with me. We were good friends then purely due to convenience I feel, and over time weâve become really different people. She had a bout of depression and has been struggling with these issues for several years now. I donât feel like sheâs responded to my own issues well, and for some reason her method of reassuring me is to âmove on, and get over itâ. Iâm not quite sure how I feel about that considering I would never say that to her. Itâs gotten to the point where she would occasionally send me messages on Facebook about her ill mental health and says that I am the only one she can talk to about this, despite having a boyfriend and other friends already. I want to cut her off, but at the same time for some reason I feel guilty to? Like hereâs an emotionally vulnerable person and Iâm not sure if Iâm just adding to her despair. But I dread seeing her messages and I get tired thinking about her. Iâve also suggested professional help but sheâs shot that down many times. Am I thinking too much into this? Thoughts?

"Are friendship ultimatums a good or bad thing? I have this friend who've I've been friends with for about 7 years. She moved across the country and is depressed for not knowing anyone she can be friends with. She's been making me feel bad about not going there to visit her. I've told her several times, I'm broke and have school obligations. Every time we talk, she brings up how she misses me and just needs a hug, and have someone (me) brush her hair, and hang out with her. Recently, I've found out that she feels there's an inequity in our friendship over the past year; because I haven't gone to visit her. I personally feel I've been there for her and her child whenever she needed me and dropped everything and go see her whenever her and her ex-husband and ex-best friend would have a fight. About two months ago, my S.O. made a bad joke and she ended up lashing out on him and making a comment about a subject that I told her in confidence, and ended up hurting me as a result. We talked about it, and tried to go back to normal. But, I realized, that I'm still hurt by her comment and told her that. She then says she's going through a lot right now and can't deal with me going back and forth on my feelings. So she said I need to ""figure my shit out"" and let her know if we can move past this or end our friendship. I've been doing some thinking and I'm torn on whether or not to try to get over this feeling of betrayal, or just completely end the friendship all together. TLDR; My friend gave me an ultimatum to decide if I still want to be friends with her or not.

"How do you talk about depression to your friends? I'm really ashamed of not necessarily the depression in and of itself but the way that I have acted with it and the way that I have (so far) failed to overcome its clutches. This shame has led to me neglecting some relationships because I don't know how to talk about this without seeming really pathetic, which makes me feel even more guilty for neglecting friends that I actually do value, but just can't bring myself to talk to. So how do you talk about this in a way that seems... I don't know - like - valid? I don't know what to say. I've been depressed and unemployed for over a year and now I have a friend calling me and I know that I should talk to them (I even *want* to talk to them - like they're awesome and I really really want them to be in my life again) but the thought of trying to explain myself - it makes me feel sick and disgusting to even contemplate. What would you say? Does anyone have any good answers to this? I really need advice right now.

"Why depression is, and isn't like a skinned knee: Some thoughts I had that I wanted to share I was just pondering depression, and I decided to jot down what I was thinking. It's sort of a good way to put words to what it feels like to suffer from depression. ____________________________________ Why it IS like a skinned knee: Depression usually comes in episodes for me, and a lot of people I've talked to. Sometimes I'll be doing okay, and then have a really bad day, or even a bad week. These episodes are sort of like skinning your knee. When you were little, skinning your knee feels like the absolute worst thing in the world. You think, ""OW, THIS HURTS SO MUCH! WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?!"" You feel so helpless. When you're an adult and skin your knee, you know what to do. You know that you're supposed to clean it, and put a bandage on it. And that's exactly what you do; you don't make a fuss. But, even though you clean it and bandage it, it's of course still going to hurt. It's a cut. You just ignore the pain, though, because you've already taken care of it, and there's not much else you can do beyond that. You just have to live with the fact that it's going to hurt for a while. Depression is the exact same way. When it happens, you know what you should do to handle it. The best way, backed by science and research, is what we've all heard countless times: Exercise, eat healthy, do something nice for yourself, clean your living space, listen to happy music, watch TV shows that make you happy, etc. So you know to do this stuff. But of course, it's not going to magically feel 100% better right off the bat. There's still that emotional pain there, just like the way a skinned knee stings. But you've already done everything you can to take care of it, so you have to live with it and wait patiently for the pain to go away. ______________________________________________ Why depression ISN'T like a skinned knee: Most people know that depression has a way of demotivating sufferers. Things you once enjoyed no longer interest you. Nothing seems like it has a point. But this also affects your drive to treat your depression. When you skin your knee, you just take care of it right away, you don't give any second thought to it. It's just what you do. With depression, you know that you should be exercising, eating healthy, listening to happy music, cleaning, etc. But you don't. What's the point? The difference is, that depression makes you NOT want to get better, or more accurately, not care about getting better. Sometimes, you're just apathetic and nihilistic, ""What's the point? I don't care. Getting better is too much effort."" Sometimes, you just want to wallow in your own despair. For me, when I feel this way, it's because I feel worthless and self-loathing. I think, ""I deserve to feel this way. I deserve this emotional pain that I'm going through. I don't deserve to feel better, or to be happy."" That's the vicious cycle that depression uses to keep you down. If you are reading this and have depression, I hope this helps you understand your own illness a little more clearly. If you're reading this and you don't have depression, I hope this gives you a good account of what it's like, so you can empathize with people who have depression. Stay safe, everyone.

"Kill myself because I don't have a girlfriend I've been a shut in for about 2 and a half years now. Everyday I stray further from God's light. I'm really embarrassed to show my face to anyone who's not my family, I really want to buy a mask for when I go outside, that way no one can look at my shame. I'm turning 19 soon, and I've never had a girlfriend, still a virgin and I'm probably going to die alone. I'm not fat or anything, i'm just a skinny guy by nature, I understand that If I want a girlfriend, I should work on myself but I just can't live with the fact that I wasted my youth being a shut in. The shame is unbearable, I want to erase any evidence of my existence, my punishment for failure will be death by hanging, this is my last resort. Death over defeat.

I was in a relationship for 7 years and he wore me down so much I stopped going out and speaking to my friends. My few close friends have always been around. Years later and now two more relationships down I find myself with nobody. I have just split up with my boyfriend and he made me sociable but they were his friends. Out of my 3 closest friends, one has moved away, the other has a husband and children and works so doesn't have much free time and the other seems to be ignoring but I don't know why.

"Losing my mind at 20! So the best label I can put is depression I donât know if that is what Iâm really going through tho long story short I grew up in a pretty bad environment had a single mother (now that Iâm older I understand stand that it must of been hard being a single mom but what I was put thru is still no excuse)who was very abusive verbally and physically I remember having brooms broke across my back and head for simply spilling a drink, when I was 16 I was stabbed by mother and was taken to the hospital of course like many children who are abused I did not speak up I guess because of fear but more because I didnât want to be looked at like a sick puppy over the years I was able to cope with my environment and it became normal the part that I donât understand is when I was 18 I decided to leave and with no real support I was homeless for a bit I used to set daily goals for myself so I wouldnât let depression set in like find a job,etc I bought a car with the little money I had and slept in that and went to the gym to shower strangely enough that is when I was at the most happiness I have ever felt flash a year later Iâm 19 have an apartment a good job and have the whole world in front of me but Iâm not happy and itâs been a year Iâm 20 now and feel like Iâm 60 I have no drive and think about ending my life everyday I just simply feel numb or like im not connected to body I also didnât mention that I have siblings and I think about them all the time I think that Iâm a terrible person for leaving them to live in that environment when Iâm free enjoying life anytime I feel joy itâs instantly sucked from me because I began to think about my siblings and think what they are going thru right now I wonder if they love me or hate me and its been taking a toll on me physically and mentally and at this point I donât know what to do I havenât tried reaching out because that would mean I would have to see my mother and Iâm no longer afraid of her she simply doesnât deserve to see me at all I sometimes think when sheâs on her deathbed will she ever feel any remorse for what she has done I also think when she goes to take her last breath will she wonder about me she hasnât seen me since I left and she wonât ever again Any thoughts on what I should do?

"Estranged mum possibly dying Hi so I'm basically in need of some help here with a big issue from people who have possibly experienced something similar. So it's a long story and I'll try and keep it to the parts the are mine to tell to keep things less complicated. So first things first me and my mother have had a somewhat rocky relationship from since I can remember, it was more of a rollercoaster and have been estranged for a year. Although the intense emotional disrupt from the relationship has lasted much longer. A brief history of this would be as follows, since a young age my mum has never been the ""settle down type"" she was always away either to holidays guys she would meet online would take her on too out every weekend. Me and my sister had to learn fast from a young age that we weren't able to live a childhood like most of our friends and basically raise our little brother. Sometimes she would be caught leaving us alone for so long and we'd have to stay with her friends so she wouldn't get in trouble and others we'd have to just make sure not to miss school so she wouldn't get caught. After years of this repeated behaviour some days easier some harder living from feast (when mum would bag herself a wealthy guy) too mum didn't win at bingo this week and a 40 fag a day habit is expensive habit to keep up why don't you just have beans on toast tonight, ofcourse I know that this is better than alot of kids we had a roof over our head and food in our stomachs it was always just chaos. Cut forward to my mum deciding she wanted to move back to ireland. I was about 10 at the time and and as such didn't want to move that's when the abuse went from none of my boyfriend's stay because of my kids too physical, she had us all so scared saying that while we were staying with grandad and granny and they heard us complaining this is what we'd get she kick us or grab us, I had been beaten before by my dad before he left so this was nothing I couldn't handle and until now never really tried to think about since. I just remember that I stayed very quiet for those coming weeks. When we moved to Ireland it was just after the first week a man showed up at my grandparents came in kissed my mum and said hello to me and my sister and said he was so glad to meet us. Turned out he was engaged to mum.....and they were planing on being married within the year, all of a sudden the reason for moving became clear. So After the breakdown of their relationship the next week the man moved back to America in the night and that was that here we were living with my grandparents in Ireland with no where else to go, my mum a big believer of why would I have to work I have kids stuck. Now I know from mum's point of view this must of been a heart breaking moment, but looking back I think this is where alot of my sadness in life begins and I hate her for it. I know hate is a horrible thing to hold onto but it's the only thing that got me where I am today and kept me as a person and I'm definitely aware I'm no Ghandi so judge me all you want but wait until I'm finished atleast. The next few months were basically limbo, we moved too late to start the term at school so had to wait until the end of term and summer to join, that's from April till September if I'm remembering right of living in the middle of nowhere in Ireland, sleeping in a room with your young brother older sister nothing to do but wait for the day to end we would take walks here or there and get to go to mass on a Saturday night but minus that it's all we had I realised then that mum had failed to do the one thing that kept giving me hope that one day we could have a ""normal"" family she was nowhere to be found off on holidays for weeks one after the other while our grandparents fed us and kept us in their home. I remember a week going by without hearing anything from her and I had to assume that's it she's gone. Yet she came back this time more shiny and brand new then ever, she said she had found us a house not to far away and go to school and it was the start of our new life. So ofcourse I felt overwhelmed at how amazing this might actually be. Mum made sure though to show her appreciation that Christmas by starting a huge family row with my her brothers and my grandparents, they had all chipped in to buy me and my siblings bigger toys for Christmas, I got a playstation 2 my sister got clothes and makeup and a bike my brother got lego ect that kind of thing, now Christmas was never a thing for us mum had explained from a young age that the santa thing was a lie and we would get what she could afford again this is not as bad as it sounds I'd rather the truth always and she at the end of the day was a single mother why would we expect anything ""big"" so ofcourse she didn't like the gesture and disowned everyone there etc But we were moving to new house and starting a new life what more could I have wanted. So after living in the new house for a week mum decided that now my sister was

"Had one of those days where I really wanted to just get out of bed and be with people: hit up my friends and no one could hang out or seemed into it. Really brought me down, man. I feel like I give a lot and don't get a whole lot in return sometimes. And part of this is probably just egocentrism. I shouldn't expect my friends to plan their day around me last minute, even though I told them I was feeling lonely. It just sucks because I feel like I would do anything for the people I care about, like I would drop anything to be there. I put those standards on other people and maybe that's wrong of me. Anyway, I just sat around with my pup and ate too much and watched tv so it is what it is.

"Nausea/heartburn from Wellbutrin I started about a week ago and was having some reflux beforehand but only really when I drank alcohol or had something really acidic. Now Iâm avoiding all that and I still have issues everyday.

I avoid eating before bed as well. Wondering if anyone else has this experience. I was maybe thinking of moving it to type evening but then Iâm worried if thereâs some 12 hour delay to it Iâm just gunna wake up with the nausea which could be just as bad but at least it wonât effect my sleep. Or maybe it will just go away with time since Iâm still pretty early on idk but itâs really fucking with me right now

"Hearing my parents doing naughty things at night scars me. Hey guys, my name is Sally. I'm seventeen this year and it's 5am right now at where I live. I don't know how to phrase my words as my head is in a mess. To provide some background story about myself, my family live in a compact flat and as a result, I sleep with my parents. In the bedroom, my parents sleep on the bed while I sleep on a mattress beside their bed. When I had nightmares when I was younger, I would squeeze in between them and only then, could I fall asleep. As I got older, when I would replicate doing the same thing when I had nightmares, I would get scolded instead. That's how the bed was - just enough for 2 adults and 1 kid-sized human, I guess? So I don't recall when - perhaps it was a year ago, when I heard the bed shaking continuously from my father's actions. He was also breathing heavily and there was this sticky sound too. Gross enough, I know. At that point of time, I was already mature enough to assume that he was masturbating. It was enough to scar me though, because it was just so strange to think of your dad fapping in the middle of the night, in the same room as his daughter. I pretended that I was asleep, but that was a really shitty experience tbvh. I tried to convince myself that he was doing something else, like rubbing his nose, and brushed it off. I just refused to accept that he might be doing something so dirty and it took me so many years of my life to actually realise it? What?! Alright so today, I found out that not only does my dad engage in that sort of behaviour, so does my mum. I'm shocked lol. I don't know how I should go about knowing this. I searched for some advice on Google too, and I now learnt that it's supposed to be 'normal'? Is it so common? I'm so shooked because I thought my family were a conservative bunch. I'm their youngest child, and I thought they would have stopped all perverted acts since I was born. So how did I find out? I suddenly woke up to hear my dad shaking the entire bed again. This time, I was really unaware and asked my dad to shut up. Suddenly, my mum nagged at me slightly and I was so confused. My mum went to the washroom and started showering? Which was so odd and made no sense. And from the corner of my eye, I saw my dad wearing his underwear and pants! He slipped them on so easily I thought it might have been a daily practice for them. He zipped up his pants naturally and it came as an instant realisation to me that both of them were engaging in some indecent shit. What. The. Actual. Fuck. I slept in the same room with them for 17 years, and today I found out that both of them have been doing messed up shit and I was completely oblivious, up until today. It's so scarring, and I remember myself pretending I'm asleep. I knew before that my mum didn't wear a bra to sleep, but I really didn't know it might be more than just because it was more comfortable to sleep without one. Lmao. I'm really shocked at how they are doing things like this while I'm asleep. In the same room. And my dad makes such obvious sounds, I think it's sick. The thought of it disgusts me. I heard somewhere before that all men fap, regardless their age. Is it true? I'm starting to feel crept out, that men are so hormonal LOL. I suddenly feel so pure and this entire thought of my parents being naughty is scarring asf. Thoughts, anybody?

"Dear depression, please please let me be. I know I can do so much good and actually get somewhere in life but you are constantly holding me down, suffocating me.

I can't sleep. all I want is some peace. you creep into my bedroom at night when you know I'm alone. you destroy everything inside me until I'm just a hollow shell of a small sad girl. why?! why can't you let me be? let me succeed? you bring fear, doubt, guilt, all the bad thoughts. I run and fight for the little bit of light I see through my window in the morning. but every night you are back. sometimes you don't even leave and it can be days, weeks, months til I get another chance at seeing the light.

"Drifting away from my best friend My best friend and I have known each other for well over a decade, and have gone to the same schools and last year when she went away. We text everyday and see each other regularly but recently Iâve been feeling so disjointed from her. Weâre really close and Iâve told her things Iâve never told anyone. She just got into her first serious relationship, had sex for the first time, got drunk for the first time and also had her first pregnancy scare (i was with her when she took the test). Weâre 17 by the way. However, whenever we talk itâs always about her life, and her boyfriend. She built up so much courage to dump him only to get back with him the next week. Theyâve known each other for only a month and he said i love you within a week of them dating. Heâs emotionally manipulative and so immature but she insists that she only tells me the bad things about him not the good things. I want to support her but she makes it so hard. She never asks about my life anymore. Iâm going through a really tough time yet itâs never come up. All we talk about is her and her relationship. I know itâs a big part of her life but it feels like my life is just irrelevant to her. Iâve never drank alcohol or had sex or even been in a relationship so it feels like weâre just drifting apart. I donât relate to her anymore. Obviously I love her loads but it feels like this friendship is one sided and purely based on her. I donât know whether to keep putting effort into this friendship or not?

"should i be upset with my best friend? My best friend of over 10 years recently took her first trip to New York City. I was so excited for her, and she had asked about what my favorite things to do when I was there were. I knew that she would love the view from the empire state building and decided to buy her a ticket up as a christmas gift. When I gave her the gift, she was really excited but as her trip has come and gone it is apparent that she didn't go despite texting me multiple times on the trip saying how excited she was and mentioning vague plans for when she might go up. I know she arrived with little to no real plans for the entire week and spent a lot of time wandering, which is why I feel that letting the gift go to waste is kind of disrespectful. I also feel that if she were upfront and let me know that she didn't go would be much better than trying to ignore that it happened. I want to know what other people's thoughts on this are before I talk to her, and also maybe how to approach her about it because this is something that is uncharacteristic of her and kind of hurtful to me.

"Lately, I've been going to sleep later and later into the day just so I can avoid ppl and avoid dealing with depression/being sad. But, by the time I do wake up/can't sleep anymore, I feel more depressed than when I originally was. And yet, despite all of that, I still have this need to sleep excessively because I keep having dreams that are more entertaining, adventurous, and exciting than what's currently going on in my life. And even when I rewire my sleep schedule back to normal, I still end up going back to the messed up sleep schedule just cause I hate feeling depressed and hate dealing with it.

"I [18F] finally feel like iâm getting better I was diagnosed with depression about 4 years ago. Honestly every single day for the past 5 years I have debated killing myself, I tried a few times but I was unsuccessful. Really I was down in a hole, couldnât seem to find an escape. My parents tried their best but were at a loss. Finally, I met A [18 M] last september and we started dating in July. And he has been the most supportive person i have ever met, would take days off of work to take care of me when I was too sad, would help me talk through things, told me why he loved me and that the flaws didnât matter to him. He is the absolute best and I havenât even thought about suicide for the past three months. It gets better, I was really lost, was hoping i would die and I found my cure. Maybe your cure wonât be someone else, maybe itâll be medicine or yourself but please donât give up because i would have regretted it so much. The world has so much more to offer

"I always wanted to go to the therapy but my very huge and overprotective gossip-loving family made this impossible for me to do Not only that but even a little hypothetical talk about it would instantly gain unnecessary panic like attention and after several phone calls to friends, family members with something like *""Hey Clara, he wants to go to the therapist. Is this normal? Which one should we call? Do you know anyone? Ask John please!""* And next day there will be several people touching my hand and saying ""Hey are you fine?"" Making it feel like something is wrong with me when I just want to talk to a professional in person without feeling like a babe. How do I know? Because my sister was depressed once and I've seen how everyone reacted to it. You see, my family's never changing mentality is ""we need to fight together! We are there for you (goddamn Fairy Tail guild or something)"". I don't blame them and I bet there are people who'd exchange everything only to be with someone as supportive. But I have always hated attention so much since I remember my self as a kid. Ironically enough I've had the biggest birthday parties in the town to boost this 'weird' hate. Doing it secretly will be risky because I actually work in my family's business as well so my tight schedule and the fact that my town is pretty small makes this almost impossible. And if someone finds out I secretly go to talk to a doctor it will have even worse reaction than just straight out telling them. Maybe I'm overreacting and have too much pride in me or no balls to admit to my family but sometimes I wish I could get invisible for just a week to sort my inner problems out. Sorry If this feels like I'm trying to make it harder for you guys to make some suggestions. It's way more complicated than that I just wanted to let it out. I've read some posts here and some of them were so so dark that my problems actually fade away a bit and I felt better because I said to my self *""yo... you are being a bitch right now, look at these people suffering here, you aren't even close!""* (don't know if I'm being terrible for healing my little wounds by reading how other people suffer). Anyways, Idk why I haven't visited this sub earlier, as I type these last words I already feel better because it is the first time I'm doing something like this. Feels like I've talked to someone.

"When should you receive photos of your childhood? Hey all, My mother has all my childhood photos and memories locked up in her closet, along with those of my late father and his family, most of whom are long gone. I'm 37, married, father of 2... I'm just realizing the absurdity of this. The other day she offered to exchange one box of photos for another ""favor"" she wanted, which seemed rather hollow to me. These are my photos, right? The way she's currently handling it is that I'll only get these photos once she's dead... That could be up to 20 years or more, she's 76 currently. What makes this even more poignantly absurd is that I nearly died 2 years ago, the emergency surgery only had about 50% odds of survival. What is she gaining by this? Is this normal? Thanks

"Susceptible Younger Sibling I have a sexually active younger sibling who severely lacks proper sex education. She will not confide in me, our parents or any family for that matter (sheâs afraid that my extended family and myself will snitch to our highly-religious parents, who are against premarital sex), but casually revealed her ""activitiesâ to our hairdresser who felt uneasy by what she had heard. With that said, the hairdresser informed me of what was said, fearing that my sister may be in danger of herself. Situation: My sister's partaking in sexual relations with her boyfriends (yes, boyfriends since they change every few weeks) WITHOUT protection. She has very low self-esteem, and goes for guys with ânothing going for themâ (i.e. no job, no education, drug-dealing/taking, etc.). But what triggered my hairdresser (whose primary concern is SAFE sex) to contact me was the fact that her current boyfriend is uncircumcised, does not use protection and has convinced my sister that âpulling outâ is safe sexârevealing their lack of adequate sex education. Furthermore, my sister has complained (to me/our parents) of yeast infections and UTIâs, checking in-and-out of the clinic on several occasions, but casually dismisses it as wearing too-tight skinny jeans. And while my mother is comfortably in-denial and takes everything my sister says for face value, my father and I have had our suspicions about what may really be going on for awhile now. Some background information: - Sister comes from an upper income family - Youngest of 3, very spoiled - Fast-tailed, boy-obsessed, hates being single - (Barely) of legal age (technically âgrownâ, but not independent, so she lives with our parents who expects her to live by their rules until she moves out). - Was brought up Christian - Strong preference for men from poverty-stricken/rougher backgrounds and engage in illegal activities (I suspect she thinks itâs edgy?) - Has a job, but devotes every last penny either uber-ing/lyft-ing to be with her (job-less) boyfriends or loaning them money - Loving immediate/extended family - Very manipulative, yet extremely impressionable when it comes to guys - Current boyfriend is from overseas, deals/does cocaine (and pressures her to join in), jobless, without education, ill-tempered, manipulative and violent. Also his parents are entirely against their relationship due to her being of a different race/ethnicity than him. - Previous boyfriend was also ill-tempered, manipulative and violent, but also physically/verbally abusive, dealt weed, had no job/HS drop-out and made a ârunawayâ attempt with my sister which was prevented after I âsnitchedâ to my parents (hence the reason she no longer confides in me, but I felt it was necessary given the severity of the situation). Cops were even involved. My parents have attempted to send her to a prestigious out-of-state college to get her mind off of guys and focus on her studies, however she shows very little interest in education, let alone bettering herself in any form or fashion. She âlives in the nowâ and has a very blinkered outlook on life. With everything said, I would like advice on how to handle the situation (i.e. what to do with the information). Should I relay it to our parents and risk ârattlingâ on my hairdresser (i.e. the source/proof in which my parents will ask for)? Should I mind my business and risk my sister catching something more severe/getting pregnant/etc.? Not to mention her current boyfriend's gang/violent/drug-related background could potentially put our family at risk (she's revealed our location/faces via social media and casual talk--entirely against our wishes) should they ever break up or anything of the sort (we had to place a restraining order on her last violent boyfriend). I have a very strong conscience and do not believe that I could live with myself should the latter happen. Sorry for the novel, but I wanted to expound as much as possible to give an accurate reporting of the situation at hand. I have always been over-protective over family (my little sister especially), and it breaks my heart to see her follow such a destructive path. Any suggestions would be very much appreciated. Thank you.

"Ending a friendship (This post is insanely long FYI) I have a mate [17M, nearly 18] whose currently in a relationship with a girl [just turned 16] that he is completely infatuated by. He buys her stuff constantly, despite his financial situation (more on that later) and does lots of other things (also more on that later). This friend of mine completely revolves his life around this one girl. He once told me he would do anything for her and that he would kill himself if they broke up (he's also depressed, which I think he should fix before even being in a relationship but it's too late now) he also said he would feel 100% responsible if she were to kill herself (she's not depressed. It was hypothetical. When I told him it wouldn't be his fault as everyone is responsible for their own actions, I simply received a ""shut up"". There have been many incident like this where I've truth bombed him and he's stuck his head in the sand and might as well be saying ""lalala I can't hear you!"" Unfortunately for my mate, these feelings don't appear to be reciprocated. He buys her gifts all the time, even though his mum can barely afford fuel due to her unemployment and the fact she's a single mum. He bought her a bath bomb and perfume and other stuff for her birthday (would be upwards of $50 (Australian dollars btw if that's even a concern) from a family that sometimes has $0 in their bank account when he didn't even get anyone else (including me) a gift for our birthdays. The girl doesn't even seem phased by his financial situation or his depression. If she cared, wouldn't she ask to not have gifts to help him out?. Not to mention that she hasn't bought A THING for my mate. In real life they seem like a stable couple but it's much worse. The mate also purposely neglects invites from his mates (including me) for her. We invited him to see Star Wars: The Last Jedi and he messaged her about how he didn't really want to go (me and a mate broke into his Snapchat account. His iPad charger is broken and he can't afford another one so he gave us username and password to Snapchat so we could do his streaks which apparently matter. Also this is another testiment to his financial situation. Can't afford a cheapo third party cord for his iPad) We looked through his messages and pretty much he's sending ""almost nudes"" thankfully with consent and a thotty dog filter picture (even though he would call anyone else that did it a thot to fit in) he also constantly asked to call on discord to which she replied only with ""sorry"" or ""can't"". No explanation whatsoever. Her friends are also incredibly irresponsible (thankfully he sees through that) When my mate is talking to me or anyone else. All we get is a bombardment ""what if she doesn't like me"" and other relationship jargon. I don't care but I have to pretend to. He cannot talk about anything else ever. It's just relationship this relationship that. I'm sick of it. When he was at a very dark time in his life, me and 3 of my mates (2 girls including the girlfriend and one guy) made a group chat to talk about how we help him. We all talked very in depth except for the girlfriend. My mate asked her ""what do you think of all this were talking about (we went very in depth into his situation) to which her response was ""I don't know"" after saying NOTHING. I'm sick of his ignorance. I'm sick of him neglecting me and the other lads. I'm sick of it all. He even tried to seize control from his girlfriend. She went to hi five me and he said ""why are you bringing him over here"" in an incredibly annoyed tone"" I know I'm only the ""when Chloe isn't present talk to him isntead"" guy. He doesn't care. How do I cut him out of my life whilst causing the least ruccus possible? (I have 2 other friends who have identical opinions so if you offered advice I'd be able to tell them too) If you have anything I need to clarify please ask and I will do so. I typed all this on a phone so it's kinda hard. Thankyou very much to those who read and answer.

"My family is a disaster Hello, I'm a 17 year old girl, and I'm tired of living. My father and my mother hate each other deeply, my father works and my mother is a housewife, recently they divorced, and both want custody of me and my siblings. My father constantly says that my mom steals money from him (he stills has to mantain us and her), and that she is a bad person that the only thing that wants is the house where we live in. My mother says that he never gives her anything (yet we live very well because he takes care of us all the time) and that when she doesn't have money for making lunch is because he didn't gave her the money and that he is making us believe that she is bad just so we go with him. I don't know who to believe I love them both. On the other hand, my father is always scolding us because of my little sister, who is always treating us badly, but when we deffend from her she is the victim. Today she told my father everything about the secrets I told her, about how sometimes I want to die, and all the thoughts I trust her, she just told them because we were having a little fight, I couldn't even tell hers because I didn't dare to. My father ended up scolding me and saying I don't value anything, and that I should stop being such an awful person, that I was one of those woman who everyone hates, just because I decided to deffend myself from her, and that SHE was the one being treated badly. My dad says always such hurtful things to me, he says that a career in music is useless and he isn't going to cost it, but when I told him I wanted to work to have my own money he just didn't let me... I want to be independent so I don't have to respect him all the time, I want to have my life, I want to be happy away from here, even if it mean not having much money, as long as I have music everything will be okay, is the only thing that calms me. I love my mother, even though too religious and hates my music, she is loving and she always says that if she had money she would pay any career I wanted, and even though my father is very cruel sometimes and wants me to study law, I love him too, I don't know how to get away from here, if I can't I don't know what should I do, who should I choose. I want to work and stop being obedient and afraid of my dad, everytime I think about how can I tell him that I don't agree with what he's doing I'm afraid, because he is the one giving me everything I have. He yells at me when I deffend myself from my sister, when I told him I wasn't going to stop listening to metal he yelled at me, also when I tell him that I won't stop loving music. He thinks he is untouchable, that everything he says is the right way, and that if I don't calm down then he will treat me even worst. HELP ME PLEASE.

"The last 3 days felt like the first days of my life. Today feels like the beginning of the last days. I have been having depression since Senior Year. I have been fighting non stop for 5 years. I took gap years to fight depression. Until last October, I thought depression has gone cause i felt totally normal at that time. During the time, I had a lot of ups and downs. Lots of tears, lots of laugh. But i have never given up on myself Last November, my brother did sth bad. And my ex attempted suicide. That is when i got depressed again. The first time in 2 years Until 3 days ago, I met a girl. ""Perfect stranger"" is the word that would suit her the most. My situation with her is exactly like in the movie ""Before we go"" by Chris Evan. 2 strangers meet each other out of 7 billion people but they would never see each other again. And 3 days after we met ( we hung out everyday for the last 3 days), she is gone. We still keep contact but I dont think i would ever see her again ( please dont ask why). She knows about depression. She made me make a promise to reach out to her every time i get depressed. The last 3 days were the happiest days of my life. It feels like I actually live for the first time. But i also got depressed since. I got depressed because i couldn't recall her image. I couldnt recall her face. I couldn't recall what she looked like when we first met. And i couldnt remember why those were the happiest days of my life. I just recall those were the happiest. All i can recall is a brief moment of her smile for like 5-10 secs, her voice, and the moment when we were about to say good bye that i poured out my heart. Everything is so blurry. Then i went on to google to search for blurry memories and depression. And it leads me to ""depression and memory loss"" and "" depression and Alzheimer "" . Then i started to shed tears. I was thinking about the day i actually lost my memories. What if it actually comes, What if one day i wouldnt remember her, my mom, my best friends, and even myself ? I was teaching in class when i shed tears. I had to run to the bathroom and cried in there for 15 mins. Luckily noone noticed. I remembered my promise to her. I was about to text her. And then i started to cry again. I will bother her. I will make her worried. I will waste her time. And i cant afford to hurt people i love. This is the beginning of the end. Please help.

"Am i a bad friend? I don't know what to do Recently two friends of mine (dating) have cut me off entirely without providing a reason... Let's call them J and K. J is an old friend from years back, when we were kids, and K has been my friend since highschool (approx. Six years). Its happened before that they've cut me off periodically for no given reason, then their idea of making up is inviting me to a party and never speaking of the weeks or months that they had me blocked on social media, when i ask them to explain they get defensive, and say things along the lines of ""you KNOW what you did"" even when i try to explain that no, i actually don't. I've never consciously done anything to hurt them, the one thing i thought it could be was that I'm friends with a girl they dislike, but after recently confronting J its apparently not just that, there's a long list of reasons why I'm a terrible friend but he ""doesn't have time to list them"" or even name one. Feeling insecure about this I've confided in other friends who assure me that I'm not a bad friend, although I've asked that they tell me if i ever act like a bitch. Back to K and J, they recently went so far as to invite all 3 of my siblings along with a crowd of people they barely know to their housewarming, but made a point to exclude me- when my brother asked why the response was along the lines of I'm ""acting like a bitch"". I've tried just cutting them out but its hard after being friends (i think) for so many years. I've tried extending olive branches, explaining that i don't know what I've done wrong and if they could at least tell me then maybe i could apologize/fix the situation, but J responded with passive aggression and K, so far, hasn't responded at all. (Quite frankly i don't expect her to). Bottom line is, should i just cut them off entirely? Its hard since I'll be seeing a lot of K this year as we're studying the same course, and J is one of my brother's best friends. Please help

I was driving downtown and I noticed someone on the opposite side of the railing. My girlfriend was in the passenger seat and before I could say anything to her. They were gone. I didn't get to see their face and if I did I think it would've destroyed me. I crossed the bridge, pulled over and called the police. I wish I could've helped, yelled something, gotten out of my car. I don't know. I didn't even know her but I feel as though I've lost someone close. I struggle with depression myself and I just wish I could've talked to her, I know we could've related on some level. That almost excites me, getting to relate to someone, even over something sad, to just feel that. Thanks for listening.

"I'm sick of my parents I just cant stand them anymore. They treat me like a shit compared to my sister. I never ask my parents for money I eat at home so they don't give me money for lunch I don't buy things I'm using old phone that i bought 6 years ago with my own money. But my mother changed 3 phones in the last year. They threat my sister a lot better they gifted her a phone for christmas i got some shitty speakers that had the price tag on and believe me their price was not close to the phone's. They bought her a new car last year they gave her the money for the driving lessons and she want money from them everyday. So i need a new PC at the moment so i thought that i might ask them because i really need it and that's the only thing i have ever ask my parents for my I haven't asked for a single cent in my whole life. Everything i buy i buy with my saved money from grandparents. I even buy my studentbooks with my own money. And they refused. They told me if i have the money to buy it but I spent all i had to buy furniture for my room if i didn't i would've gotten only a bed in my room. I feel hated. They don't spend time with me neither give me money. Yesterday I offered them to give me the money for the PC and when i have the money i will return them but they still said no. I legit have no idea why they do it. I don't go out often i don't argue with them and i have decent grades in school. They are so unfair.

"Why Iâm leaving When I was a kid a had an accident in which I chipped both my front teeth. I was 12 back then, so my dad had the funds and everything but he never wanted to take me to the dentist which went unnoticed for 4 years and just a chip on my tooth became a huge problem, I got a gap and they look uglier than they did. Anyways the thing is just right when i was going to get the work done my dad got deported and I stayed by myself. Iâve been depressed since a kid because of this and my face is actually pretty but my smile is really bad, and is a big cost to fix them since I have no sort of insurance. and I got into this big mess. A long distance relationship for almost a year now and we havenât seen each other and I donât want to because he doesnât know, his name is Ricardo. Iâm 17 now and I feel like committing suicide would be extremely selfish and I would hurt him and my family but there is no other way Iâm not happy with myself and it is what it is.

Almost every night for the past few months now ends up with me either crying in a pillow and thinking about how shitty my life has been, or researching and thinking about fast ways to die. Is this normal? I don't take any medications, nothing has happened to me/anybody in my family recently, and it normally happens at around 1 or 2 A.M.

"Dude I do the right thing to have my sister on my lap She is 22 and I am 19.. Basically and to keep the story short, she was in my lap since there was no room in the car and we were with a group of friends plus her bf and my girlfriend. Her boyfriend was driving and my girlfriend does not mind her on my lap since thats my sister.. But the others guys seemed to mind and even made jokes about her on their laps. I am 6â8 and my sister is 5â1 or 5â2 (I quarterback and she is just so petite). She feels safe when I hold her when her boyfriend is not around.

"Does anyone else feel like this? Do you know that feeling where you just feel... lost? You feel trapped in a world that you didn't want to be in, forced to try and functional like a normal member of society. You want to die, but you're so conflicted about death. You're conflicted about everything. You can't decide whether it'd be better to feel nothing or to let out all your emotions. You procrastinate so much, because it all feels so worthless. Happiness lasts a few minutes, but rarely through an entire day.

"Every Day is Exactly the Same. I'm Lonely, Worthless, and Done With Life Every day, I wake up, go to work, come home, and go to sleep. That's basically it. That's my life. Sure, I have a few friends that I see on the weekends, but it only helps so much. My ex girlfriend broke up with me and moved out of our apartment 6 months ago now. The almost three years we were together were the only time in my life where my depression was pretty much nonexistent. When she came home that day and told me she was done, I was floored. I had no idea that she felt the way she did, and she wouldn't even discuss the matter with me. I've tried meeting other people since then, and I've gone on exactly three dates with one person. That's it. I'm basically invisible to women, and no amount of effort will ever change that. I just have to accept the reality that I hold absolutely no value in a romantic context. Why? I don't know. Maybe it's because my generation is only interested in people who are aesthetically in the top tier, or make the most money. Maybe it's because my generation is eschewing committed relationships in favor of having fuck buddies left and right, whoring themselves out to whoever will get their rocks off, both men and women are at fault for this. I don't think I'm a particularly unattractive guy, and I make a pretty damn good amount of money for my age, but since I'm not in that top 10% of men, I'm just always going to be passed over and there's absolutely nothing I can do about it. It's almost like there something inherent to my existence that prevents me from having any intimacy. No matter how much money I make or how much I improve myself, that intrinsic quality of my being will always hold me back. I didn't ask for this, but it's the way things are, so I've pretty much given up completely. I don't have any plans of offing myself or anything like that. But every day, it gets harder and harder to convince myself that I actually have anything worth living for. The one thought I keep coming back to is how scared my cat would be if I gave her to a shelter or how she'd get by if I were gone. I love my cat, and she doesn't deserve to be put in a situation like that. I feel like she's the only thing keeping me marginally together. The thought of causing her any distress breaks my heart, and one of the big things on my mind all the time is simply making sure she's happy and feels safe. I feel worthless and frustrated. I wish I understood how to achieve what I want in life and be happy, but I guess that's just not in the cards. I can't wait until the day I die, I'll finally get some goddamn peace and quiet. I'm so tired of feeling broken. I'm so tired of constantly being reminded that there's something wrong with me, like I'm some sort of bastard aberration of what humans are supposed to be. I've struggled with this for 12 years now. I don't know how much more I can take.

"Do you feel the same? After seeing many of my classmates being successful in their lifes, I felt terribleâ¦ the trouble inside me just rooted even deeper. I donât feel productive as I should be. I feel like I just want to sleep forever, not having to care about anything. I texted so many people that says to text them when I need them, but none of them replied. Maybe it is because of me who scared them away? Maybe it is because Iâm an introvert who hates interacting with people? I just want someone who really cares about me, who will cheer me up when Iâm sad. Right now, Iâm just wondering why they have lifes that are so easy when compared to me? I have problem both physically and emotionally. I have been in the situation caused trauma and still haunt me every night. Iâm jealous of them. Not having any emotional pains, can someone just tell me something that will give me hope to live on? We all probably need it. Thanks in advance,

"When people say dont quit SSRIs, listen to them I was put on 20mg Lexapro through my university's health center, but summer rolled around and since I wasnt taking a physical class (online ones dont qualify you for student insurance apparently) I had to pay ~$400 for coverage in the summer in addition to actually paying for my prescriptions. I thought I was in a good enough place (not financially though, obviously) that I didnt even need Lexapro anymore so I started using my remaining bottle and taking smaller doses every day. I went from about 20mg to 5mg a day for a week or two and then I ran out. Fast forward to today (several weeks without) and I feel like i'm having a mental breakdown over every single thing, i'm a 22 year old man and have broken down crying multiple times in the past 2 weeks and have been getting increasingly angry and even violent in some cases. I was kept waiting too long in a lobby at my apartment for mail and I ended up telling the employees to go fuck themselves and ended up throwing a chair. This is all very interesting considering I got on this and xanax because i couldnt even order food wothout having a nervous breakdown. Another instance is when I stubbed my toe and proceeded to trash my entire fucking apartment and even took a machete to my fridge Dont fucking quit cold turkey. I thought I could handle it but I definitely cant. I just hope this ends soon. I honestly feel like i'm losing it entirely

"It feels as if I'm heading towards a dark place Hey, haven't been here before but I had a quick scroll and this feels like the right sub to vent to. I'm 18 from the UK, I've had a rough educational life (I alway talked, went in high with my friends, got in minor trouble that kinda thing). I fucked up college in the second year of my 2 year diploma course and got excluded for the same kind of shit previously mentioned but on a larger scale, this really fucked me up as I thought I'd end up doing nothing with my life when I really wanted to do something with it. 10 weeks ago I got a job and a paid for graduates course which pays out over Â£1100 per month after tax which is incredible for me, it's a job I love, work hard at and it's exactly the path I want to take in life career-wise. So I've been given a second start, I have money, great friends, a good social life and my life is on track but I still can't quite feel complete. I'm very social anxious and this affects my everyday life but I push through it, I have to. I smoke week almost everyday and I've been smoking for about 5 years now. The problem is, I still have a void that I can't fill and I can never really feel that happy by myself. I love my metal and I'm a huge music fan, I used to play a lot of games but I've stopped caring so much now. Sometimes I find it hard to enjoy things as much as I used to. I feel exhausted at home as I don't sleep much and the anxiety takes it out of me until I walk through the door. It feels as if it's getting worse and I don't know what to do and I don't even know why I feel this way. Sometimes it can get quite bad where I won't even feel like doing anything but pulling bongs with the TV on in the background as the day is just too much to handle sometimes. Sry for the huge wall of text but I'm trying to get this typed quick as I'm about to go out. I don't even know why I'm posting this really, I want to vent, maybe I want advise. I don't know, the fact that I'm even posting this means it's starting to get to me in some way.

"When people with good intentions say the wrong shit.. How do you deal with it? When someone who is just trying to help you says something that cuts you really deeply, or when they are pushing you when you just need them to back off while. How do you personally deal with it? Recently I had an Uncle who I was close with get involved trying to help with my depression and anxiety issues. He encouraged me to go see a therapist again for the first time in years and was just there to talk and encourage. Then when he saw progress he started pushing more and more and I started getting really stressed. Then when I had a break down and started slipping back he took said some shit to me which really cut me deep. I stopped talking to him for a while after that. He said things that confirmed what I thought people in my family were thinking abou me. Now the issue I'm facing. I don't feel justified in being angry at him because he was trying to help and he just got too excited at seeing progress that I had made many times before and then he got frustrated when it came to a halt. So now I just feel guilty at having the feelings and the anger turns inward and eats me up. But the anger and hurt don't go away from what he said either. It's been months and I just don't want to talk to or see him at all. He's reaching out again and I can't find the words to explain the anger and hurt I feel, because I feel like I shouldn't be angry or hurt. So it's just a big spiral of anger and shame. The worst part is I don't know of I can ever have the same relationship I had with him before. We were buddies. Even if I get over this I just don't know if the trust will ever be back. This makes me sad. I didn't really want him involved, but good intentions make it hard to tell people their help isn't wanted.

School was never my thing to be exact, I did decent but didnât really ever try to get super good grades. That kinda thing just seems silly to me.

"Friend threatened to ruin my therapists life over a joke. OK so I had a bit of a blur of boundaries with my therapist. It wasn't a big deal. Therapy ended and we became kind of distant friends who still chat via phone calls and texting. However I told my friend that my therapist fancied me etc whilst things were happening. I told her to promise to keep it a secret even if I died. Nothing happened between me and my therapist and we never slept together, but things were a bit... Weird i guess. Some of the stuff my therapist said could make her lose her job. Anyway I pranked my friend today by photoshopping a fake conversation between me and my college tutor. In the convo I told them my friend referred to him as ""daddy nick"" behind his back. It was merely a joke and I didn't really message the tutor any of this. She freaked out when I sent her the photoshopped convo. And her immediate response was: ""I'm going to ruin your therapists life for this!"" I told her it was a joke and a prank. She demanded evidence which i gave her... She then acted as though things were fine when they weren't. She said if I ever do anything like that again she'll ruin my therapists life. I feel as though she is basically at this point a bomb waiting to go off. She then asked me how my rabbit is doing??? Like I want to speak to her now??? Am I doing the right thing for wanting to ignore her and even removing her from my life?

"Is he justified for being so mad ?? Thoughts on my plan?? No judgment please?? 6 months ago I stayed with my aunt for two weeks but I really wanted to see my cousin who Iâve been talking to on Facebook. Well, I didnât get to see him until like the day before I was supposed to leave and didnât get to speak with him as the way we were seated at our gathering Iâd have to literally yell across the table and Iâm not like that. So later that night I got in an uber and went to his house around like 11 pm lmfao and I told him I was coming but he was like no and he was pissed that I didnât say much to him but I showed up it was raining, freezing, windy, etc and he didnât let me in and so I left and went back to the airport cuz I didnât have enough money to go all the way back to my aunts it was like 60 something miles away I only had enough to get to Newark. But he got super pissed at me and wonât talk to me blocked me on all social media but your girl is about to take that train for 5 hours and go again in like July/August but Iâm not telling him Iâm just gonna wait till he gets off of work. I have zero way of contacting him other than physically going there. Any idea what I should say so he can forgive me ? Iâm aware what Iâm doing could potentially make things worse but if I leave it be we might not ever speak again. Iâve also lost a substantial amount of weight since then and he probably wonât recognize me? Thoughts please ? I know what some of you might say but I really want to fix this??

"Help - unplanned pregnancy at 41, wife wants to keep it Hello, I need some real advice. My wife and I were married in 2011. We dated four years and the day we married was the best day of my life. We immediately became pregnant with our daughter, who is now 5. A couple of years later we welcomed our son (now almost 3). Brief introduction of us - I'm almost 41 and she almost 37. I work full time and she recently became a stay at home mom. We are middle class, homeowners living in Seattle, college degrees, financially responsible, socially liberal on most issues, have good friend circle (many with similar aged children), good family support live in area. Both of us raised in healthy and happy traditional nuclear homes. Our traditional marriage is good and based on trust, but I won't lie and say the last 5 years of raising two children hasn't been without its challenges and occasional spat. But we married for life, and at the altar when I said I do forever, I meant it. Overall, we are fortunate and thankful for our lives. After the birth of our second child, I was done. I had considered getting a vasectomy (snipped). Many of my dad friends had done it and recommended I do it. My wife was against it, and I wasn't really wanting to do it either for other reasons. My wife always semi-joked she wanted another kid, and had quipped she felt incomplete and that being a mother is her calling. She is an excellent, patient mother to our children. However, I felt it was a phase and she could get her ""baby fix"" with friends newborns. I did not feel a need to have another child, and was quite against it. I was frank with her on the matter, but because of the differing opinion and emotional confrontation, we avoided discussing it at length. Fast forward to 2 weeks ago when my wife informs me she missed her period and sure she is pregnant. No visits to the doctor yet to confirm, but we have never had problems conceiving, and I believe she is pregnant. Our birth control was her counting her monthly cycle, which she is pretty good at. I always reached for a condom just in case, but she does not like using them and told me it was not needed. Well we slipped one past the goalie. When she told me, I reacted poorly, saying it would mess up the good thing we had going, I was tired and didn't have the energy, our family was complete already. Not to mention the fact that it was be financially very difficult (we'd have to buy a larger house and I don't need to tell you what Seattle real estate is like). We are quite squeezed in our little home already. I told her she would have to go back to work. I asked her to terminate the pregnancy. To sum it up, it wasn't the reaction she was hoping to hear. The next week I bounced between many emotions. Anger, for upsetting our lives, even considering the idea she intentionally got pregnant. Fear, that our stable little family might crumble, that 3 makes an odd man out and the children would suffer. Fear, that she isn't healthy for this, as she is showing some physical ailments/breakdown that shouldn't be ignored and having another child will only fixing those off further. Fear, that I'm suffering physical ailments as well and don't have the energy to go through another round of caring for an infant. Fear, that both her parents and mine are elderly and close to needing care from us, and that they won't be there to be the ""relief valve"" and help with watching the kids when we need it. Anxiousness, that we had just got out of having the kids in diapers and were just starting the ""next phase"" of our children being autonomous and doing activities I could participate in. Guilt, for crushing her dreams and not supporting the idea of a third child when its something she wants very badly. One day I wrote out an objective list of reasons (many of which are cited above) why having a third child was a bad idea. After a few more days of trying to ignore the issue, we had our blowup. I presented her my list and she listened, acknowledging they were valid and made sense. She then countered with her belief that this was meant to be, and she could not in good conscious have an abortion. It would stay with her forever and she says she would never get over it, and would forever resent me for pushing the issue. I told her I might resent the child and her for letting this happen. I slept on the couch that night, feeling disgust and bitterness. The next morning there was nothing else to do but discuss it more. I again said I wasn't interested, and she can't force this on me. She again countered with her same argument that it was meant to be, that our ""next phase"" of children would just have to wait a few more years. I yelled I would be almost 60 years old at this child's high school graduation. I want to play sports with my kids and be active, not the ""old dad"". I said I wouldn't care, not even over the name we would give it. I said I wound't go with her to the doctor appointment. I told her she was being selfish and not putting what she has now over what she might have. She told me she would start contacting a divorce lawyer if this was how it was going to be. It's only been a few days since that talk, but I am completely stunned and not myself. I was a zombie at work, not able to focus on

"I have severe anxiety and suicidal ideation I have no motivation to do anything. If i dont go to work im in bed all day. I have no desire to text friends or do things i used to be passionate about. All i can think about is how much of a loser i am because i haven't applied to any colleges yet (i graduated in may). I see on social media people going out and having fun and i look at myself, im never out of bed. The only time i shower is when i go to work or go run errands with my mom. I am physically and mentally exhausted. Another thing, I have severe anxiety about posting on social media. Ill muster the courage to post a selfie and then delete an hour later. When i have panic attacks i delete my profile picture, bio and everything i posted that is a picture of me or i think people will judge me for. I keep thinking that my friends are just talking about me behind my back and actually hate me. These thoughts get so overwhelming that i start picking at my skin where i think there's something ""wrong"" about it and pulling my hair out. I keep cutting my hair, too. Its only two inches and it used to be down to my elbow. I keep thinking it will be all over if i just walk outside onto the freeway or swallow some pills. The only thing stopping me is that i can't get out of bed most days. I cant handle being myself anymore and i dont know what to do

"Is My Friend A Bad Friend? I have a friend. When I moved to a foreign country, I went to a school and met this friend. We have been quite close but after I moved back to my country, weâve only been communicating through texts. She has been a helpful friend but I donât know if she is a good friend or a bad friend. There were many occasions when I wondered if I should break friends with her, but I always told myself that she didnât mean to ever hurt me and I kept on trying my best to act like nothing was wrong and acted friendly. But I srsly canât hold it in and I wanna know if Iâm just being sensitive.. These are some of the things she does that makes me wonder if we should break friends.. 1.We use eachotherâs selfies as our profile pics and I always use the best selfies of hers or at least what I think are the best looking ones. And I sent her a video if me singing with my other friend and she took a screenshot in the middle of the video and used it as her profile pic and My mouth was wide open and my eyes were scrunched up and it really looked horrible and when I asked her to change it, she asked what I meant and that it didnt look bad. Sure she couldve been being nice and I couldâve been acting emotional but I really didnât like other people who I didnât even know seeing a photo like this so I pleaded her to change it but I tried to keep the joking and friendly mood. However then she said âFunny. U wouldnât wanna see the other screenshot I took.â And we both didnât say anything. And she didnât change it. 2.The way she texts me depends on her mood. If she isnât feeling friendly, she barely answers my texts and replies with short answers and doesnât laugh at anything funny I have to say. I wondered if I could also be acting like that at times but I looked back at our conversations and ai never let my mood change the way I replied to her, and I honestly didnât even speak in an unfriendly way when she said something rude to me or something that made me feel offended. 3.She doesnât act like she cares for what I have to say. Whenever something bad happens to me and I tell her, she just gives a small reaction and talks about something else. 4.She ignores my texts. There was once a time when she saw my texts and didnt reply. I asked why she didnât reply and she saw it but ignored it. I thought that maybe she had something important going on so I just kept on texting her every few hours like nothing was wrong cuz I donât exactly like showing others when I feel hurt. She read my texts and ignored me for two whole days and finally texted me back as if nothing had happened. She didnât apologize for not replying nor did she give an explanation. She just texted me about something else she wanted to say. There were lots of cases like this. 5.She acts like she has the worst life. I go through alot of stress each day cuz I have had family troubles and sometimes had been bullied. I have also often had suicidal thoughts. However whenever I tell her about things that are stressing me out, she points out that her life is worse. I understand that she has her own troubles but I really dont like the way she underestimates my life and doesnât care for it. 6.She once cyber bullied me. When I left her school and left the country, we had a small fight and she told her friends about the bad things I had once said, not mentioning her faults. She then invited me to a group chat with lots of people and they all fought against me, calling me fat,ugly,short,stupid,and dumb. They also made racial comments and insulted my mom. After a year passed, I texted her. I canât believe I did it, but I said that I WAS SORRY. And she said that she forgave me and now weâre talking like friends again. But whenever I bring up a little detail from the past, she gets mad and says that I am blaming her for the past and makes me feel guilty for something I shouldnât be guilty about. 7.She thinks that she is perfectly innocent. Iâm not saying shes a totally horrible person, she can be a good friend at times, but I gotta admit that at times she can be horrid.. And whenever something bad happens to her, she says that she doesnât get what she did to deserve it and that she is getting mistreated. If you think about it that way, I feel like I also deserve this, considering Im not a saint or an angel. But whenever my friend says that she didnt do anything bad to deserve some bad things that happened to her, I canât help but feel disappointed at the fact that she doesnât realize how much she hurted me What should I do..? Am I just being sensitive..?

I have no idea why the rudness of some totally strange person, probably between 12-16, made me so... down. I think it's because I use Reddit a lot as someway of just... Keep my mind full, away from my problems and feelings. So when someone makes you feel something, it's like a hit of reality. Escapism isn't that great, and I'm so tired of feeling bad all the time.

"Just wondering, for those who have had lifelong depression did you ever find some joy that wasnât turned to a sad story? Iâm starting to feel that depression never goes away, you just learn to manage it. I however, canât recall a time in my life where I was happy. I donât even congratulate myself when I do accomplish something. I donât allow others to either, because it doesnât mean much to get praised for things I shouldâve accomplished a long time ago. Anyways, Iâm on meds and truth is, I donât feel like myself? I donât think any drug can make me feel myself? Depression in some wicked way has made me become the person I am today. A lot of my coping skills and defense mechanisms are still present and that makes a lot of who I am.

"Cousin cutting off family. So my cousin has stopped talking to any of our family including his mother and brother. I just assumed it was just life getting in the way, but recently my dad tried to contact this cousin about some money he loaned him to buy my old car (which I sold to him well under half of market value), because my dad needed the money to pay for a surgery (he has stage 4 liver cirrhosis). My cousin never replied and money aside I can tell this really hurt my dad (he's bottling it, but I can tell) considering this is my Dad's favorite nephew. I feel like this is my cousin throwing a bit of a tantrum over having to be an adult (he just barely turned 19) and I texted him to call me when got off work to explain how serious my fathers illness is (our grandma died of the same condition) and how he shouldn't cut off his uncle who has done a lot for him, but it's been 3days already. My main motivation for this is that I know stage 4 cirrhosis can move to end stage very suddenly and I want my dad to have as few regrets and worries during what may be God forbid his last few years. I just wanted to talk about this. Advice is very welcome and before anyone suggests he doesn't have the money, he does, he just sold the car we sold him for above market value and has a very good paying job as a mechanic at a car dealership.

"I feel like a useless member of my family I may not help as much as the perfect husband would around the house. But, Iâd like to think I do a decent share of what traditionally a husband should be doing. My wife is not the most organized person in the world so me and her butt heads a lot when it come to finding things around the house. Car keys, laundry, tools, you name it, they will get lost around the house. I have tried taking my own copies of keys with me in my backpack to work or where ever I go. This way I donât have to be asking her all the time where to find X item. This was working til she lost her copy of the truck keys and had to call me to bring my copy to her one day. Since then, I only bring the key of the car that I bring with me. Well,.... didnât take too long til that one got lost too.... I needed to use the truck and was not able to find any key anywhere. I asked her where it was and she responded with âyou have hands and eyes, you find itâ. I blew my top off. I yelled at her that the fact that I have to hide things for them to not get lost in the house is ridiculous! She brought up the fact that I could do more around the house like organize the laundry or help her keep the home tidy. I told her I would if she wasnât so damn unorganized. Every time i do end up helping her organize and clean she ends up messing everything up the next day anyway! She is type A personality and I would like to think I am type A-. I yield to her way of living most of the time til it gets to be too much. Maybe the reason I donât do more around the house is because it will yield the same results anyway, an unorganized mess.... I at least do the basics. I pickup after dinner. I take out the trash, (this job now goes to my son). Handyman work, I fix plumbing, appliances, broken doors, tvâs, computers, iPhones. I would like to think that I play my role as a dad as perfect as I can. I help with homework, I play with my kids all the time. I feed them when mom works early or wants to sleep in/go to bed early. Sheâs mad at me and I feel like I am trying my best but my best is not good enough. Also, says I have become obese because of my laziness...... that one really hurt..... I try to walk/jog a good 30-40 minutes 2-3 times a week if I have time. I broke down in my car today after seeing some old photos of my kids when they were babies..... Sorry for formatting, I am on mobile and writing is not my thing. I am more of a numbers guy.........

"Getting to Know a Stranger A Human Thesis w/ a Photography Minor Getting to Know a Stranger! A Human Thesis w/ a Photography Minor Getting to Know a Stranger is a human project looking to get to know someones life by giving an hour (I always encourage it to go longer) to Getting to Know Stranger that other wise I would have never met. There is no monetary exchange only one of friendship and kindness. I would like to document our meeting with a few candid photos only if you are comfortable, if not, a conversation does the trick! Getting to Know a Stranger is all inclusive and strives to get to know all walks of life. I welcome all ages, gender identities, races, religious views, economic status.â¦. you know every type of Human! I know that in my own life I have felt extremely alone and isolated in my own mind many times, and have felt that there is NO one who understands what I am going through. What I started to notice was through my own travels and tribulations I have noticed one thing, we are all a lot a alike, and most of the time share a more relatable story then anyone in my inner circle. In todays technology the human interaction is becoming less and less human and more and more digitized. Screen watching instead of people watching, direct messaging instead of a hand written letter are methods of detachment driving a wedge between our true selves and the human being sitting across from us. So how do I make a change in my own life toward fighting this black hole of being digitally programmed, force fed fear, and made too wallow in my insecurities. Get out there and meet people of walks of life and commit an hour of my time each day to an individual who could use a human interaction. A little about me! My name is Aaron Bistrin I am a 28 year old guy from Santa Cruz California, a beautiful place to grow up. However it wasn't always easy growing, Santa Cruz can be a tricky place to navigate as youth and I found myself in quite a bit of trouble very young. This continued into my early 20âs and after a series of life changing events I started to make some serious changes in my life. As one positive lead to another, I found myself opening a restaurant in my home town at the age of 25. Fast forward a few years and I have found myself out of the restaurant industry and creating an alternative marketing company with my best friend. This is where I found my love for photography and content creation. My passion for human interaction and learning about people has been inherit nature since I was a child. I feel when meeting strangers our filters are down, there are no pre programmed family/community paradigms, is this not the best opportunity to be your true self? So what better than combine my two passions of photography and human interaction into a Human Thesis with a Photography Minor. Getting to Know a Stranger. If you or someone you know could use a kind interaction by Getting to Know a Stranger, please comment below or shoot me an email at abistrin@yahoo.com. All meeting are private unless the consent from both people is given. This is a project of human kindness. Hope to meet you soon! Much love! Aaron B

"I've never liked myself. Honestly, I think that my entire life I've been depressed, but now that I'm older (19 y/o), I've realized what it actually is. All my life I remember hating myself and wishing I could be somebody else. I thought it was normal. I always envied just about everyone else and thought the worst about myself and every action I took. The only time I *ever* felt happy about myself was after a psilocybin mushroom trip. But that's besides the point. I've always hated myself but I was too naive to know what it was and I thought it was normal. Why can't I be normal? Edit: You know what, fuck this I'm gonna edit this. I don't think I'll get better. I don't think there is a better way of living. Anytime I am ""happy"" or ""over it"", it all comes crashing the fuck down and becomes 10x worse. I don't trust that fucking shit called ""happiness"". It's always a lie and always lets me down. I'd rather be depressed and suicidal because at least I know it's real. It's not some bullshit fleeting feeling that I get that leads to disappointment. Reddit comments and therapists and shit can tell me I'm mistaken, but that's all bullshit because it's all a fucking lie and the only real emotion is emptiness, fear, self loathing, and paranoia. Sorry, but for me that is it. Case closed.

"Has your family always ignored your problem? I think the hardest part of being depressed since I was a kid is how absolutely ignored I was/am by my family. My parents split up when I was 5 and my father died when I was 10. My family completely sweeped it under the rug like I was supposed to be completely ok with it and it has never been a topic of discussion at home. I walked around sad, slumbered over, quiet, avoided eye contact and stared into the distance for years and years and no one ever assumed proper to ask if there is something wrong with me. The only time they sent a psychologist my way was when they had to determine who I should live with after divorce. My mother to this day seems absolutely oblivious to my suffering. I don't ever feel like telling them for they will propably assume I'm ungrateful and spoilt. I've had everything! They sent me to school, fed me, put clothes on my back. What else could I possibly need? I don't want to burden or blame anyone for what has happened but just I feel so abandoned.

However, I canât sleep, no matter how hard I try I normally lie awake for hours and when I do sleep I just wake up like 5-7 times a night. I only want to use sleeping pills as a very very last resort. I try to not use electronics before bed, or to watch something happy, but that feeling of being small and smothered and scared and full of dread is still there. Any ideas on how to make it better? TL;DR Sleep is elusive, i want to sleep more than anything. Please help.

"blah I'm having a hard time at work today. The hand sanitizer smell makes me want to drink. This persons mom dropped off a lunch for them, it was sweet, made me sad and miss my mom. Usually these things don't really get to me, but I woke up in a weird mood this morning. So everything seems so loud and apparent today. It kind of feels like the lights are screaming into my eyes.

"I feel like I'm in a rut. I don't like it here. First post here, so here we go Like the title says, I feel like I am in a rut. I am tired 100% of the time, regardless of the sleep I have had (quality, length, etc). Feel simultaneously under-utilized and under-qualified for my job at the moment. I don't feel like I am doing anything worth-while, but I also don't even feel qualified to do even this job. When I get home, all I want to do is either sleep or sit in front of my computer. When I am on my computer, I never do anything productive, just get into YouTube holes that last forever. I try to be creative; maybe try game design, or start writing; but it all just falls flat and I feel worse, not good enough. I have no real friends (not including work acquaintances, who all have their own lives to live) in my area, all of them are online, and again, they all have their own lives too. I feel unimportant, I feel un-unique (is this even a word? words are hard), I feel exhausted. I don't know what to do. Even now I feel stupid for writing this on the freaking Depression subreddit. I just feel alone.

"Is it better to find out your love was a lie, or never to have loved at all? Last year, after 16 years of marriage, my wife says she never loved me, has never found me attractive (who can blame her), and doesn't think we've ever been right for each other. She only married me because she felt pressured from family and church to get married, and I was a ""good guy"", as she puts it. This crushed me. She has been everything to me. I have always loved her so much. My whole marriage has always been a fairy tale for me, it was everything I wanted. This was the girl of my dreams. I remember thinking when we were dating that it was too good to be true that any girl, especially one as amazing as my wife, would ever like me, since I'm shy, boring, and ugly. I guess I was right, it was too good to be true, and I should have trusted my gut and known it back then. After a year of trying to find ways to connect with her, make myself more attractive to her, and hoping she'd love me, I've finally accepted that she never will. We are staying together for the kid's sake, and really for mine, what else would I do, no one else could ever love me, and I doubt I could ever really love anyone else the way I loved my wife. I've accepted that I will never have love. It makes me wonder, is it better to have thought I had love, and enjoyed it, only to find out it was lie, or never to have loved at all. At this point I really don't know.

"Today is my 21st birthday. I'm spending it alone with a bottle of wine. Birthdays have always been a bit of a sore spot for me. To quote a very old comment of mine, ""13th birthday: I had just been let out of a mental hospital a few days before. My mother finds out she has a brain tumor. My only friend at the time gets sick and goes home early. 14th birthday: All my friends but one bail on me. My parents scream at each other until my mother packs up and leaves. 16th birthday: My family and I go out to dinner to a restaurant that my dad chose solely because he had a coupon for it and buys the world's smallest birthday cake. Halfway through my birthday celebration the following weekend my friends abandon me due some drama bullshit that was apparently more important than me. 17th birthday : Dad starts an argument in the middle of a restaurant in front of my best friend. After we get home, the argument continues, resulting in my dad physically attacking my mother. All while my friend and I sat in my bedroom."" To add to that, my friend's mother died of a heart attack on my 18th birthday, and I spent my 20th alone due to the fact that all of my old high school friends had moved on and my best friend had decided to join the military. Well, today was my 21st. My best and only friend completely forgot about me. My dad then made me have an emotional meltdown. Now it is nearly midnight and my only company is the nearly empty bottle of wine sitting next to me, so I am not only sad, but also slightly drunk. Happy birthday to me.

"What do I even do with this friends? They are one of the best friends I have ever gotten. And only friends as for now too, since I find it really difficult to make friends, and to keep an stable relationship without screwing it up even thought what I value the most in my life is my friends. As of the last 2 months they have been unactive (We only talk online and see each other from time to time), not talking to me, saying they get bored of our conversation, never starting a conversation. And never consider to invite me to hangout, they just do it for themselves. I'm not sure how to feel anymore, when I am in person with them we have tons of fun, and sometimes when we talk the conversations are really interesting and fun too. I always feel uneasy and not comfortable about them... So what should I do? If you want more details as for something ask for it.

There is a concert I want to go to so bad, but cant because of that. And I am really sad because all these years I tried being friends with people completely different, and all it did was make me more depressed and feel like I was a mistake. Clubs are 18+ too.

You can cry, and scream all you want but at the end of the day, no one is gonna be able to understand you, and the deep well that has been buried within your mind. So what if you grew up rejected by every girl, guy, and person? So what if you've just turned 18 and endured waves upon waves of mental abuse? At the end of the day, when you're laying in your bed, and your demons are starting to swallow you whole and fill up the bowl, what do you do? You face it. You indulge yourself in them until the pain is numb, and you can't feel anything anymore. It may not be healthy, but it's better than suffering. Happy fucking birthday bro, have your cake.

"Painfully lonely and spiraling into the worst depression I've ever been in I recently moved to a new city for a job after college. I have a few friends at work, but they're a group of guys that I don't have a lot in common with and we don't really talk outside of the occasional work conversation. They're nice and I'm happy to be friends with them, but it's hard for me to really get to know them because they do ""guy stuff"" on the weekends (like sitting around drinking and playing FIFA) that I'm totally not interested in/they don't bother inviting me to. Other than that, I have a few online friends that I'm growing increasingly dependent on for social interaction which is really unhealthy. I notice myself getting more paranoid with them about not responding, and I bug them way too much to the point where I know I would definitely be annoyed if I was them. Also they're not very supportive (probably the opposite) but it's not their fault -- they're just causal online friends that shouldn't have to cater to my current host of mental problems. I'm totally alone. My family and college friends live 4 hours away. I have pretty bad social anxiety and I'm terrified of every new social interaction I have. I work 9 hours and come home to my empty apartment and watch netflix to escape my own life, every day. I sometimes hear from my college friends about all of the fun they're still having together and it honestly brings me to tears that I have such a pathetic lonely life now. I've never been able to have a ""normal"" social life -- it takes me forever to make close friends, and then even at my best I only have a handful of good friends at a time. I don't enjoy going out every weekend or the other obvious ways of making friends, and that wouldn't work now anyway since I would NEVER go alone and I don't have a single person that I could ask to go with me. When I was a freshman in college I had this same problem -- absolutely zero friends and living in a totally different city. It was the worst depression I've ever been through. I had dozens and dozens of online friends at the time (now we've all lost touch and moved on from the RPG we were playing) that helped ease the loneliness, and I eventually joined a student club and finally made friends after like a year of going. There's not really anything I can ""join"" like that in a non-college town... I've been applying for a few volunteering things, they haven't started but I'm doubtful that it will be a good way to meet people. I honestly just need ONE person to talk to. Anyone. I don't know what's wrong with me, I'm not a complete weirdo or anything and I know I can have meaningful friendships (just 90% of them have been online, and now I can't even seem to make any fucking online friends either), but I live the loneliest life of anyone I've ever known or heard of. I've never been serious about suicide, but recently that's changed and it's becoming something I could actually picture myself doing. I'm a long way from that but at this point I don't see anything getting better and I practically cry myself to sleep some days and have to hide emotional breakdowns at work after eating lunch alone. Does anyone have any advice for meeting new people in a non-college town? Anyone else having the same problem? I'm so lost and sad and pathetic

"Sick and tired of my family and my sister's fiance So what I'm about to share is a very, very long story so I'll try to shorten it without leaving out too much info for better context of the situation. My fiance, we've been together for 3 years, is currently in basic training. There were a few rough patches before he left, partly due to the fact that he wanted to get married before leaving. I love him to death and I know he wanted to get married to get the benefits started but I didn't want to base our marriage off of benefits. I know it won't be and I know he wants to do his best to help us. When I asked why he joined, he said one of the main reasons is to provide more for us and to take care of me, which I'm grateful for but I never wanted him to feel like it was all on his shoulders. That's why we planned to move out towards the end of the year and why I'm on college, to be independent, have stability and create my identity. Now for background info, my fiance and I have been living with my sister and her fiance along with our younger brother; our brother has Autism. Our mother lost the house due to her opioid addiction and we found a place for us to rent together. Our dad left the state the summer before my senior year of high school. So as always my sister and i pick up the pieces and make sure our brother is taken care of. We all have been living together for almost 3 years. Since we've moved into our most recent house, it has been a shit show. 100% of the drama that occurs in the house is due to her fiances family and they don't even live or pay any bills here! Surprisingly after a year of being here they've calmed down but my fiance and I are tired of it. Also I need the ability to live my life and grow as an individual. Having to hold back and set aside my needs and wants is getting tiresome. I barely even want to have children of my own because ive been a parent to my own brother. I don't feel comfortable where I'm at now, I feel like I'm only here because it is convenient, I don't feel appreciated at all. I know my sister wants to keep the family together, or what little we have left but I need room to breathe. Also when I was 16 her fiance offered oral sex to me, I know I should have told her but I also knew she wouldn't have believed me especially given that he is her first everything. I still feel uncomfortable around him at times. My sister cares and trys her best. She wants to buy a house and move down to Texas, that's where we used to live before pcsing to Washington state. I understand the position she was put in, we both had to endure the chaos that was our family these last few years, well since I was in the 8th grade really. However, her goals and mine don't align and I don't feel like compromising those for anyone else anymore. My fiance and I just want some peace and the ability to deal with our own problems, in peace without hearing people argue in the next room. We had a plan to move out towards the end of the year but he didn't want to wait. He was even going to school, he had started his first quarter. I asked him to consider the reserves because he could go to school and when he's done move on to active duty but with him being so stubborn he went active. It's not that I never wanted him to join, my father served 22 years and I want to join as well. I'll support him for however long his career will be but now I'm trying to figure out how do I move on and start my own family. Not that it'll include children right away, but just my fiance and I. When we get married he will be my priority and my family as well, I just don't want my sister thinking I've chosen him over them. But also I need to make decisions for myself. Just about every decision I've made has always needed me to make sure I'm available for other people. I'm tired of always being available. My sister sometimes acts as if she takes care of our brother on her own but that is far from the truth. We've both had to do the same and yet I don't think she really appreciates it, at least she won't until I move with my fiance. I'm not sure if many of you are familiar with this term but enmeshment is the term I'd use to describe my family. There is no boundaries and if you deviate from their mean then you're an oddball. I know I said I'd try to keep it short and this isn't even half of it. I want and going to move with my fiance after I've graduated and we are married. He's getting deployed after OSUT, so I'm thinking it'll be best to get married after and itll keep some stress away from having to worry about doing before he leaves. I appreciate anyone that takes the time to read this, advice is greatly appreciated.

"Calling me a bitch as a form of endearment not cool This was a great friend of seven years. We had so much in common and a few things not in common. We met in our mid and early 20s (im being 5 years younger). We met on a the job years ago. Well five months ago when she was stressing about her day... Listen bitch our manager gave us more rules.... Time froze like huh? :/ð¨ Also I'm 30 shes 35. I let it slide since I thought maybe that was a mistake. Maybe she was so stressed out? Well it didn't end and got worse... Everyday she leave me text messages, and recordings updating me of her life and each sentence I was called a bitch. Listen BITCH.... Yeeees BITCH..... Then this BITCH at work....,but you get me BITCH.... I told myself, BITCH you need to hit the gym ( Yes at times she called herself a bitch which is fine.) Lucky for men they'll never get called bitch by her. I made excuses for her saying maybe it's a temp phase. 3 months in I told her I don't like being a bitch every sentence positive or not. She said this how her and her family always talked. I thought I known you for 7 years...never heard of this. Then she continued to talk and yup calling me a bitch. I continued telling her to stop at times. Other times I just tried to ignore. One month ago she texted me that shes working with a nurse who is a woman who has a grill in her mouth. And how cool she thought that was. And how she hopes to become a nurse someday with a grill. I had to catch myself....to me grills look ugly on men and worse on womenð. I faked it like....yea...um cool... :/ Well a 5 days ago I got fed up. I told her 6 days ago calling me a BITCH 50 or so times a day must stop! We never had a argument...maybe a few disagreements. She went off and was pissed I didn't want to be called bitch for fun. I told her I'm not a dog in heat! I told her my name and that I'm a girl or woman hell even calling me a female is nicer. She said shes not about that girl power or that feminism crap! FYI...shes actually into feminism and don't know it. I would love to be a house wife,take my voting rights away and I love dresses. Shes willing to support a 3rd world man soon,talk about how if she gets a great degree she can support her man lol. I felt myself at the time great sadness here she was going off at me for not wanting to be called a bitch. She then says her family call each other bitches alllll the time. After she went off....she went back to talking about how she wants to go to school. I never felt so degraded and disrespected. I decided this friendship ends. I'm very nice, and consider how others feel....she basically treated me like a door mat. Next day I texted her I'm not a dog. Not into being called a bitch daily and I no longer can do this. After I texted that I blocked her number asap. It's crazy about 3 or 4 months ago. She was mad that when she called a coworker a bitch instead of saying girl or other friendly terms...she caught that coworker talking about her warning others to stay clear of her because she will call you a bitch. She called me about it all mad. I told her I actually understand that girl....she completely ignored my remark. I plan on changing my number soon...maybe. But I do feel better that I don't have to hear that hood talk anymore. I was her only friend. Hopefully she can make new friends who don't mind being called that daily. I have friends and recently by mistake made a new one. New one is like me and we respect each others boundaries. I like that shes another race as well,so I can learn her view of things. Yes just glad it's over. Now if I'm called a bitch it's a insult :)

"Is it me? Hello. This is my first time posting here. So the other day one of my friends texted me, saying I think she's dumb and that she demands respect (this is a month after I just hung out with her; everything seemed fine). She then accused me of insulting her and the school she goes to. I insisted that she took what I said out of context (for example she said I think her major is easy. I never said this, I said it wasn't math focused. Plus she herself said she is having an easy time). She constantly asks me if I think she is intelligent and I always tell her she's smart in her own way like everyone is. Anyway, I said sorry and have a good holiday but she didn't reciprocate and just told me to watch what I say and not to tell anyone she said this. This isn't the first time this kind of thing happened. One person I know just hates me (quote:""*** hates you and everything about you. He just does."") and I have no idea why. Sometimes he's cool, other times he ignores me (he has pointed out that I'm light skinned black and he's dark so apparently I'm treated better; eveb if that's true I am not responsible for that). Another person hated me for reasons unbeknownst to me (excluded me from group chats and gatherings, made this known to others) and now I'm told they love me (largely made up with this person but I never knew why they hated me to begin with). I'm extremely confused by all of this. Now I'm a guy who was known as the smart, quiet kid in school with a lot of knowledge. Occasionally I'll let people know my opinions and they'll get a kick out of it. However, I really made it a point to be polite to people even when I disagreed with them or didn't like them. Most people I know say I'm genuinely kind or polite even to the point of being boring.I go out of my way to refrain from cracking mean jokes or speaking bluntly because I know it'll offend people. I try to balance the thoughts in my head and the words I speak (isn't this normal?). Most people at my current school say I'm very nice and friendly. Am I doing something wrong or are people just being bad/weird to me? TL;DR: I tend to get people who hate me and I don't know why; most people say I'm a kind and logical person.

"I need help to understand it myself Dear people of r/depression, I need advice for motivation and mental calmness. I have had my share of depression in the past, but I have tried hard, so hard to make my life as happy as I could. But I think recently I have lost all my motivation for everything. There are days where I just want to play games and sleep all day because that probably is the only way to keep me bloody sane. Then there are days where I completely fine, but I don't think I have the same fire in me when I was younger. Recent mistakes (Failing in my university units, failing to find a job, failure in relationship) are making me nihilistic, self loathing and just feeling really pathetic. But of course, I can't just keep using my mistakes as an excuse to not get the fuck up and do something with my life... but I think I have ran out of ideas and motivation to push myself anymore.

Never played sports, never got a job, never had real friends, never had confidence just anxiety (I believe this to be a major factor that prevents me from doing things). Stay home all day on PS4, no motivation, no happiness, no passions, and no dreams. Most would say they look forward to getting out of high school yet I'm the opposite. I don't look forward to the future. I don't want to go to college although I probably will anyways, and I don't want to work a job I'll hate. I'm a lazy shit and I hate myself for it.

"What's wrong with this friendship? I need some thoughts on this situation. Three friends of 20 years decide a month a head of time to go to a Gatsby Party for New Years Eve. All of them are single. Well, at least one of them is somewhat single. The less-single one is Charlotte. Charlotte has a new beau, who she has been seeing on the low for about two months. Melanie and Jenny can see that Charlotte is smitten. Ok, no big deal. All is good. ""Do you, girlfriend! Just don't lose yourself"". (Names have been changed) So everyone is planning for the NYE party. Melanie and Jenny have their outfits ready to go. The dress that Charlotte ordered is not going to be in on time for the party, so the back-up plan is to go the mall and find a new dress. Melanie goes with her, and Charlotte, reluctantly buys the best dress she can find, but it is not nearly as fabulous as the first dress she ordered online - which, again, won't arrive on time. The ladies planned to all go to Melanie's house early on the day of NYE to slowly get ready, play some good music, eat pizza and have a few drinks before they summon the Uber to take them to the party. The night before, however, the party's promoters announce on facebook that the venue has changed to another location. A little aggravating, but not a big deal. They decide they're not gonna let that mess up their NYE and want to have fun anyway. Anyhow, on Jan 31, at 5pm-ish, Charlotte sends a group text to the other ladies: Hey ladies, i know you'll probably hate me for this, but I'm not gonna go. I wasn't feeling it since they announced the change of venue and now James asked me to go to Vegas. So I rather do that. I apologize for the late notice"". Needless to say, the other women were very upset. Any thoughts? Should the other ladies accept that?

"I can't handle this anymore I have no perspective in life. I am 19 but I feel like a 50 year old alcoholic. When I drink, I can't stop. Just for your information: I am ""only"" a social drinker. But the thing is, I am done. I don't know how I could get old. I can't handle life now even though I get everything spoonfed by my parents. I don't know how I could handle it later. I'm at that point where I don't even care if a car hits me. The thought of death is just so relieving. Btw I'm incredibly drunk (again) right now and I just wanted to share this.

"Friends don't seem to want to do anything unless I do all the work? I've been running into this problem a lot lately. If I don't pull all the weight around my friends, nothing happens. Admittedly these are, yes, all online friends. I don't really have ""Realside"" friends any more. It's complicated. What I mean is- if I don't start a conversation, there will be no conversation. If there's a lull in the conversation, I've got to fill it or the conversation ends there. If I make plans with my friends (Usually to play a game, watch a movie, something like that) there's a 90% chance they'll forget, or just lose interest, or ignore it. And a 10% chance they'll halfass it when it happens. What the hell am I doing wrong? I can't be sparklingly, Vegas-Light-Display interesting 24-7, it's fucking exhausting. But if I'm not, I'm alone.

"Is my friend a narcisist? I have this ""friend"" who I find kinda annoying. Because of my not so social nature I am used to being the third wheel, but this person, let's call him ""Eric"", seems to have me as an option. Now, we met each other due to a drama club where I managed to get myself into a script writing role, he wanted in. Me being an innocent 11 year old at the time, I didn't think much of it. Now, 17, here are a few factors that lead me to believe the title: 1) I dont care about what other people think of me. Whenever he can he always speaks to his other friends, let's call him ""Mark,"" Mark doesn't like conflict and therefore listens to everyone. I am his secondary option. 2) Whenever I do better than him at something he always tries to make himself seem better and that I just got lucky. He says things like: ""You just used 10 more minutes, so you did worse"" ""You always get lower or equal to the mark I get."" 3) he tries to get me to adapt to him by saying things like: ""Did you really choose that haircut? Its bad"" Or ""I am dissapointed in you"" And ""We're soul-friends"" (trying to make me agree with him) 4) He is always butting into conversations with my other friends, trying to pull me away from them 5) He tries to convince me that I'll do better at life with him rather than anyone else. Again, I don't take any of this to heart and generally just ignore him, but should I make it clear that I know what hes doing, or am I just being paranoid?

"Feeling Trapped Hello, I am 22 and had quite severe depression during the age of 17-18. My past 3 years of life from the ages 19-22 have actually been great and I have had no problems. I have had a girlfriend since the age of 20 whom I love. I have worked a few different mundane jobs, and have been going to school for electrical engineering. I am entering my last year of undergraduate school in the ASU online program. The reason my depression has returned is because I feel trapped, mainly due to my living situation. I would consider my upbringing to be the low end of middle class, and yes I realize there are people much worse off than I am. I grew up in a family of 6, 2 parents and 4 siblings including myself. For the past 18 years we have lived in an 1800 sq. ft. town house in California, right off of a busy street. There are 2 rooms in the house. The master bedroom is rather large, I would estimate about 2.5x as big as the other bedroom. Up until a few months ago when my sister moved out, all 4 of us siblings were sharing the smaller room. Now there are 3 of use sharing it, but still two bunk beds taking up the same space. There is absolutely no space, and I am 6'3"" tall and do not really fit into my twin size bunk bed. My mom has kept the large master bedroom for herself over the years, and has forced my father to sleep in the living room, despite the fact that he is the one who pays the bills. She is a selfish person. My desk, which is where I try to study and work, and where I spend most of my time, is in the living room. My dad is usually in the living room watching TV, and there are lots of noise and distractions from other people and the kitchen etc. which make it nearly impossible to study or just relax. This didn't really bother me much as a kid, but now that I am 22, it is getting worse and worse everyday. Because I do online schooling (which was not what I intended) , I have little to no interaction with peers and my schooling is basically sitting in front of my computer at home. I feel completely trapped. The bedroom I share is completely cramped, and usually one of my other siblings is in it. In the living room I am surrounded by distractions and other people, with absolutely no privacy. It is hard to study or focus on anything. I feel like I have no space to myself, like there is nowhere to go. I often feel extremely anxious and depressed, and feel as though someone is cramming me into a box. This makes me just want to cease being conscious. All I think about is how badly I need to move out. Every night it is getting worse and worse, until I decided to come here tonight to post. Due to school payments, and buying a car, it is not possible to move out with the mediocre job that I have. There is still another year until I graduate school, and even then I don't know for certain if I will be able to get a job that will enable me to move out. I will still have to pay off school loans after that. The thought of staying here for another year, or even worse 2-3 years is completely unbearable. My girlfriend and I have made plans to move out together eventually, but that probably wouldn't happen for another 2 years minimum. This had made me extremely depressed and anxious the past 6 months. Does anyone have any advice for what I should do? I have been considering spending more time at libraries during the day. I have also been trying to spend a little more time outside and at the gym etc. But if anyone else has been in a similar situation, please give me advice. Note: I know there are people who have it much worse. Homeless, disabled, etc. I realize that and that is the main thing that I try to think about when I feel depressed and anxious. That I have it better than some people. But this is just my personal situation I am trying to deal with.

"Why is my dad like this My brother was recently tripped in the cafeteria as a joke. It was another friend and they do it to eachother all the time, but my brother ended chipping his front tooth. The two of us go to a joint middle/high school and I really appreciated all my guy friends who went up to talk to him and ask if he was ok. Today these two guys ask me when he's going to get it fixed when I have to admit to them my dad doesn't want to take him to the dentist but rather just get him a grill. They laughed so hard. (This just seemed like a fun story to tell I didn't expect y'all to take this so seriously. My parents are separated and Im assuming that once we get to my mom's house she'll handle my brothers tooth.)

"I used to know exactly what I wanted to do in life, but now when I look foreword all I see is eventual suicide. My whole life Iâve wanted to go enroll in Animal Studies at NYU to eventually get a degree in zoology. Itâs been my dream for as long as I remember. I was going to get good grades, get my driverâs license at 16, stay in shape, eat healthy, get married, have kids, earn enough scholarships that most of my college was paid for, and get a job that I loved. Basically be the perfect woman. But now, everything seems so impossible. Iâm currently failing most of my classes because I canât find the motivation to do assignments, which causes anxiety to wrack up even more than usual. Itâs just been awful. Anyways, when I try to look foreword once again that my young, stupid self had planned out when she was little, all I can see is... nothing. I just want to be clear that the only reason Iâm still on this earth is that I know suicide would crush my family. I want help, I really do, but my pride wonât let me ask. And even though I (temporarily) decided to live, the call of the peace after death still calls out to me. It reminds me of our past flirting through the angry wounds criss-crossing my arms and the knife bloodied with my own blood under my mattress. I just want, more than anything, for this pitiful excuse of an existence to end.

Fuck everything about communication, it only makes things worse. I honestly don't need anything else adding to the massive weight I bear.

"A song of fire and ice Hey everyone. I'm on mobile so pardon my typos which will happen. I'd like to take this time to thank anyone who reads this as well as giving a shout out to anyone currently struggling with depression. I have a long history with Type 1 Bipolar Disorder. Although that isn't necessarily depression in itself patients who are Bipolar are bound to eventually oscillate into that emotional polarity. To give a quick summary here is what happened to me: I grew up incredibly wealthy. My Father was an ex alcoholic. My Mother died when I was 13 and my Father went back to drinking to cope with the loss of his wife (my Mother). My Father became suicidal and threw everything we had away. We went bankrupt and I went to live with my Brother across the country. My Brothers wife left him shortly after I moved in. He became suicidal as well, ended up hospitalized. I moved back across the country again to live with my then pseudo homeless Father. One day my Father shows up to my school drunk, gets arrested, I am taken in by the state and put into foster care. I end up living with an incredibly poor hispanic family and eat almost nothing everyday. I have no bed. I sleep on the floor. The state then places me in an incredibly religious home where i essentially become a slave and i cook and clean nonstop for an extremely wealthy catholic couple. They don't like me Because I liked hard rock. My third stay I end up living in a small apartment with a woman who was good at hiding her side prostitution gig and methamphetamine addiction. After all the years my Father gets his life back under control. He begins dating a wealthy woman who isn't a fan of me. He takes prolonged stays at her home about 40 miles away. He would visit the house to restock it with food, pay the bills, then leave again. During this time i saw my Father maybe 15 times a year. Each encounter was brief and lasted less than 30 minutes. During this I still went to school, cooked, did my laundry, and did kind of normal kid stuff. The point of this story is I am an adult now who is married. I am a software engineer. I am financially stable. Regardless of how dark it gets it is possible to make it out on top. You have to focus and be strong. Do whatever you need to do to survive. If anyone has any questions or would like to chat, need advice, whatever please let me know. I currently do volunteer work to aid people who suffer from Bipolar Disorder as well as others like ADHD or OCD. I also, accidentally, mentor Fatherless children on Xbox Live (strange, I know). Its not easy out there and world and parents sometimes forget how hard it is being a teen. No judgement. I hope everyone has a good night (or day, depending where you're at).

I tried to ignore it but there were just constant posts like that I just can't look at anything she posts anymore because some how it makes me more depressed and lowers my self image even more though it's already at zero.

"âBest friendâ didnât invite me to celebrate 21st. Iâve been friends with this girl for over ten years. We were our first best friends. We ended up going to different schools throughout high school and college, but we never drifted too far. Yesterday, she turned 21. She was coming into town to go to a local bar, but Iâm not of age yet. She told me I could come, but I figured she was just going to be there with her boyfriend and other friends who are 21. I didnât want to sit there drinking a Sprite while they all got drunk, so I let her enjoy her evening. I figured she would celebrate later again anyway (which she is.) Today, she posts on her Snapchat story her and all our mutual friends (underage friends) drinking and having fun over in one of our friends apartments. I was not invited. I got her a gift and was ready to celebrate with her. Iâm pretty disappointed, hurt, and feeling lame as usual. This has been a common theme for the past couple of years. She hangs with a select group of about 5 or 6 people who Iâve known longer than her. I donât really get invited to anything at all, only once in a blue moon. She sometimes tries to hang out with me when she comes into town from college. Is it time to take a huge step back from this friendship? I donât feel appreciated and I feel the effort is not there. Any advice?

"Lifelong friend keeps lashing out So I have this friend, she's my best friend and have been forever. ?We've been friends since we were 2, we traveled the world together. We're now 25. She's been through a lot, difficult family stuff, life isn't easy on her at all and her entire life is struggling. Honestly, she needs me. Without me she'd be pretty lost and she knows it. I pretty much take the mothers role. Her mother isn't there (and usually she's more destructive than anything) and I do a lot of the stuff mothers do, including being her punching bag. Because of all of this, she tends to be very impulsive and when she's upset she can say stuff that are very hard for me, like she can get upset with me and then say mean stuff, and that she wants me and everyone else to f-ck of and leave her alone, sometimes worse. It doesn't sound too bad but when it happens repeatedly from a good friend when you try to help her it's really really hard. Every time I have to tell her that it hurts me, I have to practically beg her to say sorry. Eventually she breaks down and says she's so sorry and that she can't control herself. I always forgive. The thing is I know she doesn't mean it. And also I know she's naturally impulsive. But also I don't think she's really trying to control it. I know she's got so much on her plate that it's natural to lose control and not be able to always control everything, but it's really hard for me even though I know she doesn't mean it. Right now I honestly don't feel like I want to talk to her. I think the fact I ALWAYS forgive makes her not really try to control it. She lost dozens of friends because of it but she know I will always stay. Right now I just feel like telling her that it's been one time too much (I've warned her before that eventually I might just unwillingly break), and that I can't take it. I forgave her probably over a hundred times, seriously. And I honestly care about her, and I honestly know she doesn't mean it, and I honestly worry that without me she won't be able to survive. But also I just can't stand being a punching bag anymore, it's emotionally exhausting and I feel drained. I don't know what to do anymore. I can't live my life like this but I can't live my life knowing that my leaving ruined her, which really might happen.

"Is this my distorted reality? Okay, I almost always run into this problem with friends, and I'm not sure how to get out of the situation without feeling guilty or ashamed of losing yet another friend. Situation One There's this friend whom I helped many times and every single time other people bashed me, she would either laughed with other people or further ridicule me. Things like asking me to fix her phone, helping her find a place to rent, providing her with advice on many issues... I have since asked her not to further ridicule me, and her response was, ""oh this is not what I do, but I would like to remain friends with you because you are a resourceful person and you see things differently."" I kind of ghosted her after I graduated from university, but I always wondered whether I handled the situation appropriately. She always tries to avoid me in public space, but when she gets into a car accident, she would call me and ask for help. I am neither interested nor in love with her. I actually felt she might be in a hopeless state, that's why she wanted my help. SCENARIO TWO I have this friend who always makes weird implication towards how stingy I am. They made assumptions about my contributions to me and my SO and said things like, ""Oh, if given the opportunity, would you kill [so's name] and claim his insurance policy"", ""You know greedy people normally turn out to be the poorest bunch in the population right?"". The fact is, I have been contributing to the relationship between my SO, my SO is older than me, so in a way, my SO is more financially independent. At times when SO is helping me out, I always mark the number down so I know how much I owe SO [actually he calculated the amount and sends me invoices]. But I won't disclose such details to my friends. I am just disappointed as to how people assume things and the last thing I want is to be the victim in every f*ing relationship. Is there something I am not seeing here, is there a problem with how I am handling the situation well?

I was never really in love with any of them except for 1 and was mostly in it because I loved the idea of a relationship. I don't like being alone and I fear I'll never find someone I truly love and who loves me, leading to me living my life full of sadness and regret

"Why did my friend do this to me? Here is the context, this guy and I were friends for 11 years, but he works at a coffee shop full time for 40 hours a week. Also, he moved out of his parents place and lived in a condo with his 2 brothers. Every time I try to invite him, he always tells me that he's busy and that he does not have time for me, but when I see a video or a photo of him on facebook or instagram, I see him making time for his other friends, but never me, and he never invites me either.

"Standing in the Rain Standing in the rain Letting the clouds cry your pain Your own tears don't pour No one checks in anymore A fraud seeking attention In reality you're quietly seeking intervention There's no knocks on your door No one checks in anymore Take a long walk down the lane And stand alone in the rain You hate yourself for being sick The mind's candle burning at both ends of the wick You're losing your grip on what matters,on what's sane But none of that really matters when you stand in the rain How long can you play this game Before you fall into shame and pain Who knows, so today let's just stand in the rain Because tomorrow might not be the same This is probably terrible but I've got too much free time and my mind being idle is very bad.

"Silent friendships SOS Hello good people of Reddit, My BFF (since like kindergarten) is one of the most important people in my life and I absolutely adore her. Weâre different but complimentary personalities and have always gotten along great. (Sheâs an INFJ Enneagram 1 and Iâm an INFP enneagram 4 for reference if youâre into that kind of thing) ANYWAY, weâve always had an issue (or at least I have) with communication. I love and value conversations with friends. She does too, but when weâre together we rarely have conversation. She doesnât respond to a lot of my attempts to make conversation (which honestly makes me feel like an idiot, and over the top.) We recently decided to room together and itâs completely exacerbated the silence and my own insecurities. Itâs hard for me to continue to update her on my life and ask for updates on hers when the conversation is so strained - and this is my main confidant, best friend in the entire world. I know she values our friendship and cares about me. Sheâs just quiet. And Iâm insecure about that. I just donât know how to live with the lack of conversation because I feel like thereâs a lack of friendship in our quiet apartment. I really would appreciate your insights, as I want to either confront the situation - or my own issues - and make things better. I would love to hear your experiences with friends and conversation and introversion. Do you have friendships that are silent? SOS!

"I'm afraid to be alone. People are a distraction but once they're all gone I can't help but get anxious of the idea that I am here in my room by myself with my thoughts and there is no one out there that I want to give me some closure. There is no one out there that I want because the conversations with them feel so meaningless and unhelpful. I feel aware of my mind and feel like this whole world is a distraction of some dark shit that's happening behind it all and it freaks me out and I don't know what do, I'm afraid.

"I began to openly discuss my depression to my friends. It was very painful to discuss but I think it's a step in the right direction. Up to now, I have never discussed my depression with anyone besides my husband and my therapist. I have slight PTSD from when I was kid and a teacher had been ""concerned"" for me by some disturbing behavior. I felt even more misunderstood and felt so much anguish that I became really good at disguising my depression. I hid it under a fake, likable, version of myself because I wanted to fit in and feel like I belong. Currently, my closest friends are my coworkers but they the most judgmental people I've known. We became close by commiserating together at work. Fast forward a few years, I am finally starting to feel better after seeking help for my depression. I've been seeing a therapist for over a year, began taking antidepressants two months ago, and have been taking cognitive behavioral therapy sessions. As I begin to feel better, I also feel more miserable hanging out with my friends. I decided to be more open with the people around me about my depression. I revealed it today for the first time with one of my closest friends. It was incredibly scary for me... I haven't felt this vulnerable in a long time. My friends typically see me as a guarded person with a hard exterior, but I felt tears welling in my eyes. He was very surprised to hear, but I'm not the first person he knows with depression so it was reassuring to know he didn't think I was some sort of freak. He also commended me for taking steps in getting better and encouraged me to continue talking about it. It was a positive experience overall. I then decided to tell another friend later in the day because I was feeling good after the discussion I had earlier. It went a little differently though... His first question was, ""what do you have to be depressed about?!"" which instantly flooded my mind with negative feelings of remorse. I tried my best to keep calm and answer his questions honestly. I explained that it's not any thing or anyone that is making me *feel* depressed. It's a mental condition I have which causes me to be in a persistent state of sadness and worthlessness. He asked me if I understand where Eric is coming from (his bipolar nephew that he sometimes mentions), and I said yes. He then seemed to become more curious and asked me many questions about what it's like. In the end, I feel like I educated him on depression and hopefully helped debunk his belief that depression is just a feeling that people should be able to snap out of. I honestly don't think I could have these conversations if I was in the state I was even a month ago. Even today, I felt myself slipping into the familiar downward spiral. I don't know what kept me composed today, but I'm so proud of myself for making it through the conversation without snapping or becoming defensive. Perhaps if I had these conversations in reverse order, it could've been a completely different experience. I hope this inspires others to talk about it, seek help and be open to receiving it. It was quite uncomfortable but I am happy to create an opening for other people to understand what we are going through.

"Bed time and the tears... Every night it is the same song and dance. We have dinner, clean up, bath, games/tv, bed. I say okay guys, wrap it up and go pee and get a sip of water it is bed time and the moans and groans begin. It continually gets worse as we go up the stairs and get to the room. I have a 4, 7, and 8 year old and they like to sleep in the same room, it is a bunk bed. My 7 year old is crying because she says she never gets to make choices and she canât wait to be grown up and she isnât tired, etc, etc..... My youngest becomes kind of rowdy and doesnât know where she is going to sleep or who she will sleep with. My oldest is the best, he is actually ready for bed and just laying, waiting for the show to end. I have a steady bed time each night, around 9:15. I am open to suggestions and new ideas. I am at my wits end with the night routine. It actually makes me really sad because no matter how much I do it is never enough for my children. I truly do want them to be happy. I give them several warnings before it is bed time to make sure they are doing what they want before the nights end.

"(New York) Who's in the wrong here? I'm a little upset over a disagreement with one of my best friends that occurred in late August and has resulted in us not speaking or hanging out since. We're in college and we were out together at a party. We were talking to some random guys, and I left because I saw my ex and was talking to him. My friend texted me asking where I was and I told her I was talking to him. She told me to go to her and I said okay, and asked if he could come. Then she just said i'll just go home see you later. I was like, no don't leave alone I'll come with you without him. But she kept refusing my offer and ignored my calls when i tried to find her. When she got home she complained to my other friend that I ditched her and made her walk home alone, when I offered to go to her and tried to get to her before she left. Since then she said she was taking time for herself whatever that means and literally hasn't contacted me since. I have tried apologizing numerous times and being normal but she isn't really having any of it, and says she isn't mad at me. We haven't spoken in around 2 months now and I'm really upset because I didn't feel like I did anything wrong for one of my best friends to hold some sort of weird grudge and I miss her. Did I fuck up?

"Hello out there.... Ugh. I battle with depression, anxiety, bulimia, OCPD, BPD, and some physical health issues. Not so sure about battle right now. Maybe more like grudgingly coexist with? I'm 42. I've never held a job with the same company for longer than 3 years, and that was just once. A few times (I think) I've made it to the 2 year mark with a company. 1 year is a bit easier. I had to quit my last job because it was too easy to use the job to fuel the eating disorder. (I lost 40% of my starting weight in about 7 months, before I switched phases and ended up with a pulmonary embolism from refeeding syndrome.) Right now I'm in the initial hurry up and deny me so I can get an attorney phase of applying for disability. Thankfully I have a sister who is letting me live in her house, so at least I'm not homeless. (TBH, most of the time she's out of the country, and when she is here, she's just as selectively social as I am.) Because of waiting to get on disability, I'm off my medicine. I can't even afford the cheapest ACA insurance, and even if I had that, I couldn't afford the copays for my medicine. I'm not eligible for Medicaid in my state until I get approved for SSI/SSDI. I'm not too worried about not having my antidepressants right now tho. This is probably the most pleasant major depressive episode I've ever had. It's not so much feeling horrible psychic pain as it's just been a gentle bleeding out of the vibrancy of life. I sleep as late as I can every day, (usually until around 1 or so), hang out in bed playing games, reading, or watching videos, and only really waking up and being willing to be awake around 7 in the evening. I don't feel like I'm living anymore. I'm just in a holding pattern. I think back to what my life was like, even 8 months ago, and I mourn for it. At least I'm not suicidal. I think I just need a place where I can come every so often and unload my mind. Thanks for sticking around to the end of the post.

"I Feel Lonely and Scared I'll End Up Friendless. Need an Ear. Ive come to the realization that I'm really scared I'll end up with no friends. I used to be the type who kept in touch with friends for years. But, I have either lost touch with or outgrown every friend I had in high school. The new ones I made in college are nice people for the most part and ended up being my roommate group (since sophomore year. I'm a 2nd semester junior.). But every friend group has their faults. And with this one, I don't feel like I fit in completely. 4 out of the 7 of them are know-it-alls who will try to correct you on every little thing (like one time I was exaggerating and saying somewhere had 100x more people, and one of them came out of their room and said ""Um, I think it's actually 1000x more people."") Those 4 are also really uptight, don't get my sense of humor for the most part and seem like they're always trying to school me on what's appropriate (MIND YOU I NEVER JOKE ABOUT RACE OR OPPRESSED GROUPS OR ANYTHING OFF LIMITS LIKE THAT.). I just don't always feel seen or appreciated or like my intelligence is respected. There's also one I don't even like that much (no matter how much I've tried) because she has an arrogant, self-aggrandizing, my-way-or-highway attitude. The point is I don't always feel in sync with them. Even the ones I do feel in sync with, I don't feel like they reach out to me nearly as much as I reach out them (when we're not in school). And I don't like one-sided friendships. I'm worried we won't stay friends after undergrad. Also this year, 2 of them are graduating and I have to find a new roommate to fill in the spot that'll be in my room. I'll admit, I didn't make enough effort to hang out with people outside of my dorm, and everyone had settled into their friend groups so it's harder to make friends now with the people at my school. I don't know what to do. Part of me feels this is my fault for not getting a single in the first place, and trying to join this friend group when it was already established. They eventually came to see me as a member, and we've had good times but I don't know that these are ""my people"". And part of me wants to get a single room next year, but I feel like I'll just be jumpstarting my social isolation and I'm also scaredy new roommates might be lunatics. Tl;dr - I've lost touch/outgrown my high school friends, don't fit in with my college friends, and am scared to end up alone without any friends. Need advice.

"Cousin Iâve not seen for 25+ years trash talking me to my son (sorry long post) I just need a rant and maybe some advice on what to tell my son. My youngest son (15) came home last night and said he was invited to a party this weekend and could he go, after all the âmum checksâ I gave permission. He then proceeded to tell me that the mum of his friend âhates me and that I hate herâ and I found this odd as I donât particularly hate anyone and certainly not one of his acquaintances mums. It turns out that she is a cousin of mine who I havenât seen for 25+ years since the death of our grandfather, her father accused me of stealing my grandads Home and contents, not true but I did care for my grandfather at his home, that I bought, and my grandfather lived rent (and bill) free for 2 years prior to his death. When he passed away, my uncle said he wanted things from the home for himself (I had no issue with that) and when my uncle (this ladyâs dad) said he wanted the TV I said he could take the rent book for it too (my grandad rented it from a local place). My uncle was pissed but accepted that it was rented. I also put into boxes all the things my grandad had willed my aunts and uncles for them to take away after the funeral - some couldnât bear to and I put it in storage for them to take at a later date. Now Iâve lived in my home since then and over the years changed the house to my taste and extended it. Unbeknownst to myself (until last night) each time I changed something my uncle has bad mouthed me to other family members and run me down, convincing others that I stole the house from them (was a rental property when my grandfather moved in and it was myself who purchased it). Over the years I have noticed that my family are not very communicative with me but Iâve put it down to initially my brothers death (4 years after my grandad) and then my mums (a few years later). But after speaking to others in the family last night Iâve discovered what has been said about me. Now I donât particularly give a damn about whatâs said about me but I am upset that my cousin has told my son that I hate her, he is autistic and things like this stick in his head. Last night I just said something like âI donât know the lady how can I hate her? And is that something you think I would do?â To which he agreed that it wasnât something Iâd say/do. My problem is the party, the parents are going to be there (one of the reasons Iâm allowing him to go) and Iâm concerned that they will trash talk me to him and how do I explain to him that some people just believe what they want regardless of what the truth is? I donât want to give him all this information before he goes as itâs not really a problem unless my cousin makes it one, of you see what I mean. Thank you if you made it this far and any advice would be appreciated.

"Trying to make me jealous I once asked some friends about where they get one of their ""items"" and they both seemed to shrug it off, laugh and basically show that they don't want me to know. I thought wow ok didn't expect it from friends but I guess some people are petty about some things. And they knew that it got to me a little that they didn't tell me but whatever. Now they would bring up the topic of this ""item"" here and there knowing how they treated me regarding it. I have strong suspicions they are doing it to spite me or prod me to give a reaction or just to reinforce their ""dominant"" position. They probably get a kick out of it. The problem is, I don't know the best way to react to it when it's brought up in convo to show that I'm not envious or jealous. And I'm not jealous of it at all as I actually found out what I needed to through other means, it just bugs me that they think it does and so I don't want to give off that vibe so they can go into a private convo and laugh about it.

"I'm not worth it I just don't feel like I'm worth anyone's time or effort, and I just feel like a burden to everyone. I have a part time job (anywhere between 20-39 hours a week) and I'm at college (in the UK &amp; I'm 18)and I'm constantly tired. My mum is such a lovely person, but I really do feel like she'd be better off without me, she's always complaining how she never has time to do anything (she works 30 hours a week + she always cooks + cleans up after my stepdad and brother but complains about any mess I've made) and I'm lazy, messy and I quite often ruin her day. But I'm sure I've ruined her whole life. She had me when she was 19, which meant she had to quit her job because she couldn't afford childcare and she had an abusive step-dad, who would refuse to let her mum look after me, and she also fell out with her very religious grandparents as she wasn't married (they have since made up). She then couldn't get a job until I started school (which is actually a decent job). At this new job, she met my step-dad (after a few years) and they've since had a child together (who also doesn't seem to like me one bit). My step dad seems to hate me more than my mum does, but I can't complain because neither of them are abusive, and this is one of my problems; I feel like I shouldn't moan about anything in my life; I live in a decent sized 3 bedroom house, I have an education and I also have a job. Whilst my mum lived with her abusive step-dad, was forced to quit college (so she could get a job to start paying rent) and was also forced to baby sit whilst her parents went out drinking every other night. Yet here I am, never feeling happy, without many friends (I talk to the people at work when I'm there and I have 2 other friends that I speak to around twice a month, normally because there other friends are busy and they want to complain about their boyfriends, or because the other friend doesn't want to go shopping on her own ( another reason why I don't have a reason to be negative; she was in care and now classified as homeless as she's now 18 and not catered for in the care system, so now she has to live in temporary accommodation with lots of drug users in the same building.) I feel like I just ruin everything, if I'm downstairs with my family, there always seems to be an argument, even if I'm not involved in the argument. But if everyone else is in the living room, whilst I'm upstairs in my own, I can only ever here them laughing and enjoying themselves. It's like, even when I haven't done anything, I seem to just produce a negative atmosphere. I really don't want to be here anymore, if I disappeared, it wouldn't really effect any one, my mum might be upset at first but she'd quickly realise how much better her life is without me. The problem is that I'm even too lazy and stupid to kill myself, so I'm just secretly hoping that a medical issue that has been ongoing for a while (and I haven't been to the doctor's in years because I would just be wasting their time, when they could be helping someone better than me) is serious, and nature will take its cause...

"I lost my father recently, and now I have less suicidal thoughts This isn't gonna be what you think it's gonna be.

I am extremely sad he passed away while I'm in such a young age (I'm 21) but c'est la vie I guess.. The reason I'm now less likely to commit suicide is actually I won't / can't do this to my mother.

I just can't do it to my mother to spend even more money that she doesn't really have. So now the feeling of guilt 'if' I were to do it is bigger than my misery.

"Dealing with loneliness? I canât speak to a therapist, I canât change my reality, I canât even really take a step forward. My situation is what it is; there is no solution at the moment. I have to live and deal with where Iâve gotten myself, and I have to continue to work to get myself to a different place, so loneliness is my reality. I truly donât have anyone to talk to right now. Havenât really for a while. Does anyone have any tips on dealing with loneliness? Iâve been dealing with it in very unhealthy ways lately.

"Should I let my brother live with us? Not sure if this is the right place or if another sub is better, but here goes. I have a brother, 29, turning 30 this year, who lives with my parents. My parents sold their house and have not yet decided where to live. They are 65 and 70 and are retired. We own a small apartment building and live in it and rent the units. My parents will have some cash and also have monthly income, but my brother appears to be very depressed, may also have some untreated medical issues, and is a sober alcoholic who may be abusing prescription drugs (not pain pills, but Xanax &amp; Ativan? Not sure). He seems to sleep all day and rarely goes to his job, which is doing over other people's houses as a contractor. He owns his own truck and tools. My parents are worried they'll ""lose"" him when they move if he doesn't move with them, but nobody knows what to do or what his real problem(s) are. Is it a stupid idea for us to just have everyone live in our building and subsidize my brother's ""rent"" by having him pay some nominal amount subject to regular psychiatry and/or other requirements? Has anyone done this? Is there another sub that is better for these types of questions? I don't know if anyone knows what to do anymore. My mom enables him but is finally making an appointment for him to see an internist, though he is very manipulative and secretive so I don't know what to do or if anything else can be done and I am somewhat concerned he will manipulate the internist--he's very deceptive. I don't even know if there's a name for what he does.

"I lost my closest So recently one of my biggest fears came true. I donât have many friends and thatâs because I always feared that a friend would know me and just completely hate me. So I only had like two or three friends for this reason. Then I was diagnosed with depression, so I tried to tell my best friend at the time that I had depression and that over the last year or so that may be why I had done some weird drastic things (in this time I never did anything to harm my friend emotionally or physically). While I was telling him he became hostile towards me and then told who told his girlfriend who in turn became hostile towards me and told me I was a shit person (A shit father and a shit boyfriend). That was 3 months ago. So I stopped talking to them because of that I tried going to my closest friend about something I never talked about ever to anyone and it caused them to walk away. Then I sought out help and I started to recover from the issue the and I made regular updates about on Facebook because I was finally ready to talk about my issue, but one day when I said I lost a friend him and the other person I thought was my friend attacked me in the comments because I made a side comment about what happened between us. I never mentioned names. I tried to move on with my life but they were the only friends I really had and I so completely distraught because I donât know what to do or honestly really how to make new friends. I feel like now since it has finally happened to me I can deal with people who I thought were friends turning their backs on me but I just donât know how to make friends. Can I get some advice on what to do. Also Iâm a 22 year old guy with a baby and a happy relationship. Do I even need friends?

"I've been in a constant rush to try and get on my feet for the last three years, but I always end up doing nothing about it. I've forgotten what motivation is all about. Hey there, I just turned 22. And this is my situation: About three years ago, I used to feel excited about everything. Finishing school, starting my studies at a university, being self-sufficient, finally doing what I thought was my future career. I'm not sure what happened, but I started losing my drive. Things didn't look as exciting, nor entertaining. Never having even kissed a girl, I felt alone and loveless. Still, I felt motivated enough to start working on my social skills, met a few people over the Internet, even got a girlfriend. (Thanks to the Internet I have a social life, as ironic as that sounds, even though it's not that good). Fast forward to this year, I was able to date a couple more girls, had a good time but they all ended too soon. I've never been able to have sex with the girls I've been with because I lost my sex drive in the course of these last years. Also the extremely low self esteem and self hatred don't help. Today, I find myself unable to even have a conversation with someone, mostly girls. I can't come up with anything to talk about and I feel like all the things I learned about social skills have gone away suddenly. How do people have such natural conversations with one another? How did I manage to do it before? I feel like I want new friends, I want to have a good time, but can't figure out where to go, or what to do to achieve that. Regarding my studies, this year was a slow one. In the time I should have completed 50% of my career, I only completed around 20%. I started visiting a psychologist because I can't get myself to study for my exams (I'm not cooperating much with him), and all I do is worry about it though I never take up the responsibility. I am fully aware of the fact that things don't come if you just sit and wait, but I can't bring myself to do anything other than complain. Meanwhile I feel like my mind wants to run, but doesn't know which way to go, and my body won't budge. I think 24/7 about how I'm getting older, and I'm wasting every second of my life. I'm completely lost and feel like everything I do is going nowhere. And I don't even know how to end this post, just wanted to put this somewhere and hopefully get some solutions or words of encouragement from people who've been through the same. Sorry for the long read.

"I sob thinking about my painfully wasted young years I'm going to write this hopefully without stopping to think myself into madness with corrections and such. Too late I just backspaced two whole sentences! There is this big fucking hard block of concrete in my head that stops me from doing anything including things I like such as drawing and reading. I love going on tumblr and pinterest and deviantart to look at the amazing drawings and paintings people are able to create. Sometimes though, I get really jealous of the fictional characters in the fandoms. Heck, I get really jealous of people in my life and around the world; young people. I just get this sinking, dreadful feeling inside my chest realizing that I'm wasting my young years doing nothing. I'm 24 now, and looking back on my life I've just been a sad, pathetic underachiever with no drive or history of doing anything adventurous. I'm wasting my young years. I'm wasting my young years. It plays over in my head all the time. I can't get my brain to shut off. Every night before I go to bed it plays over and over. I'm just so sad and disappointed in my life and how I've done nothing with it. Even as a little kid I never did anything fun and I don't have any wild stories of adventure, excitement, nor things like ""Lol we were dumb kids yada yada...We did this all the time yada yada..."" I'm sorry for the rant. Writing it out didn't help me get the chants out of my head. I'm so sad guys. And I know that fictional characters are deliberately made to be fascinating and have amazing lives, but there are people who were born 5 years before me (who are real, yes) and they are really living their lives to the fullest and are doing amazing things. Right now I want to go out, rent a solid 4x4, and drive to some god knows where designated dark space and lay on my back and gaze at the stars in the night sky. I want to go do something fun and amazing, but knowing I've wasted so many years being depressed in bed, on my computer, sleeping, and just doing nothing will haunt me forever. Please take me back to being a little girl again. Let me try again please.

"Family problems Hello, I want to talk about things in my household now, and maybe get some opinions on it. Okay, so my sister is 22, she's the oldest. I'm 14, the middle child, and my brother who's 12 is the youngest. Our dad works abroad and comes back a few times a year. But we talk on phone almost everyday. My sister studies in a university and comes back usually on weekends and then maybe some other days depending on her schedule. When she comes back everyone in the house starts fighting and she's the problem. When she's home, everything we do is wrong. We were ""raised"" wrong. Mom ""spoils"" us. Mom doesn't ""love"" her. We ""don't want her here"". And when my mom says that she causes the problems she bursts into tears, goes to her room, cries for a bit and leaves to her boyfriends house because ""she feels loved there"". And that's how it always goes. She comes back, says that my brother doesn't do anything in this is house and that he's a spoiled brat, fights over something, bursts into tears and leaves. She is very emotional. When she accuses my brother of something and he calls her some kind of name she immediately stars crying like it's the end of the world. Last night she texted my mom, saying that she raised us poorly and that mom doesn't love her. She said that she's gonna be leaving our home and won't come back because ""we don't want her there"". Of course, me, as the peace maker in the family, wrote her a huge message about how she is wrong, how we actually love her is just that she doesn't see it and everything else. She wrote back, about how I'm wrong, about how my brother is spoiled and again, everything else. I will agree, my brother is the youngest and he can be a brat. But that's the point, he's the youngest. And I don't see how you can make a problem out of everything. Like dude chill oml you're not dying. Guys, how the hell do we make her understand. Or maybe she should leave? Get some time alone? Maybe understand herself better? But she's an almost adult, she should be the smart one, she one that understands.

"How to disown my sister How do I remove my 18 year old sister from the family? Iâm her younger brother (16) and all my life my sister has been nothing but manipulative towards my parents. The main issue is when she turns my mom and Dad against each other, resulting in her being free to do whatever while our parents scream at each other, leading to my mom crying or then separating for a few days. This isnât the first time itâs happened, which is why Iâm taking into serious consideration of kicking her out of our family. I understand my sister means a lot to me so it wonât be easy but her behavior have made my mom cry more times than I can count. Unfortunately, my parents are also very soft on her so they will not go along with me trying to disown her. I understand some people might think Iâm a terrible person but I have lost a lot of respect for my sister where this seems to be the only Option. I appreciate all advice :)

"Feeling numb Iâve realized that if I canât talk to someone about my feelings then the next best thing is to write them down and seek advice from reddit so here I am. Iâm on campus right now preparing for my midterm and my confidence is at an all time low. I havenât even seen the paper and already I feel as if Iâve lost. I never thought I would reach such a low in my life. Something weird happened today. I finally set up a countdown timer to the day my exam results are announced. That seemed like the next logical step and it made complete sense to me in a weird way. The only thing that made me remove that was talking to my parents and seeing the hope and love for me in their eyes. I know my life isnât truly mine and that if I hurt myself then I also hurt other people but itâs just getting too much. The thought is always there in my mind and for the past few days that voice has gotten stronger. Iâve been through this period before and had come out nearly unharmed and at the beginning of the year I was feeling optimistic about whatâs to come but that lasted all of one month. The future I was dreaming of looks bleak and distant and with every passing minute that future keeps on going farther and farther away from me. I try very hard to keep my guard up near people I know and love but itâs becoming harder and harder to do so. I used to think that I was destined to do some good in the world but maybe that was just me being delusional. Itâs getting harder to keep the tears in. Whenever I used to feel numb, I used to punch the wall just to feel something but even that is not helping now. All I wanna do is talk to someone and pour my heart out but I donât know if I have the strength left to do that. Getting out of bed is starting to feel like a struggle and for the first time in a while Iâm afraid of myself, of what I might do if things donât go my way. I know that this is not the end of the line but why does it feel like it is? How can anyone recover from such a failure? Itâs gotten so bad that I would much rather prefer that I disappeared than having to tell my parents whatâs wrong. Depression is nothing new for my university and it wouldnât be the first time that someone took a drastic step and now I know why they did what they did. The pressure and stress which comes with a university as respected as mine, is just too much to handle. Iâm almost inclined to reveal my universityâs name just in case someoneâs able to figure out who I am and I can finally get the respite I desire so much. All around me I see happy faces and I can only hope that one day I can leave all this behind me and be happy but in the meantime I guess I just have to struggle on and wait for the light at the end of the tunnel.

Anyone who knows anything about North American geography knows that Canada is effing huge and so it's expensive to travel that far west.

Anyway, when she found out, she was pissed I'm not spending that money on going out to see her instead. And she said something like ""if I had any extra cash I'd be using it to come see you""... Which makes me feel like absolute crap. She clearly doesn't understand wanderlust... I wanna see other cultures and it's just not the same to travel within your own country.

"So depressed that I developed disassociation. So I am going to bed after posting thus so sorry if I don't respond right away. I am 32. My short and sweet backstory is that I lost the love of my life because of alcoholism and depression. The way we broke up was the worst thing to happen to any person. She basically called the police on her way home from work, had me put in jail for a week on false charges and since I moved out of the state I couldn't call my family while I was incarcerated and charges eventually dropped. It broke me so terribly that I literally split personalities. I have the me that stares deep into the darkness all the time and the me that deals with and tries to make sense of the aftermath. Every time that person takes over I feel a part of me being lost. In a way it us insanely scary that depression can eventually turn into this. For the record Yea I do see a psychiatrist, a therapist and have a great support system. It just sucks because even with all that I am losing thus battle. Thanks for reading.

"I'm unsure of our friend status - it's making head go crazy and heart go ballistic A few months earlier this year a friend of mine and I had dinner, we started talking about our personal lives - I've discovered things he went through and it hurt my heart to find out what he went through. He was able to open up to me and I felt privilegged to be that friend whom he's shared this with. He's closer to two other guys other than me but he's told me he hasn't told anyone else his dark side other than me. I hope to open up to him one day. Ever since then I felt like I want protect him and see him find his happiness/ reach his goals and find the girl of his dreams. My head has going around in cirlces and I feel like I need to have a proper conversation with him to confirm what this friendship means to him. As to me, I felt like I met a really cool guy whom I would call one of my best friends - we laugh at the same jokes, share some similar interests and I find him inspiring. ... I guess what I'm seeking is advice on how to approach him about this. Just because lately I feel like there's a gap between us that I try to close by talking to him more but... I just don't know.

"People are NOT who they seem. I originally wrote a long post detailing the specifics of what just happened to me, but I decided not to. All I'm saying is, **don't** trust anybody. You have **zero** assurance that people who act nice and fine when you're around are really nice and fine towards you when your back's turned. I wouldn't have known the true, judgmental, and frankly I have no fucking idea where in the ass of God did they pull all their judgmental shit - if I hadn't snooped and read text messages of my mother to other people. Hell, my own mother's in it, too! ""Hide the knife, he might stab our son (my stepfather)."" ""You're sick, go to a doctor for a checkup. You can't give up, please don't die. We pity your son. He can't survive without you. He'll burn all the money with booze. He'll be homeless and sleep on the streets."" Jesus Fucking Christ. What in the actual fuck? I don't even drink. Jesus Christ. What the fuck. The judgment. Dear fucking Christ I could not believe nor comprehend how this people even came to whatever bullshit thought/idea they came to. Suddenly, I'm back down to self-doubt and I can feel depression clawing at me, it's trying to rip me apart again. But, no more. I'm pushing it back. I've confirmed EVERYTIME, that family is my main source of toxicity. FUCK THAT. I'm being ganged up on by everyone in this house, and their relatives, and every single one of my relatives. I once questioned if I was the one at fault. I mean, if EVERYBODY hated you, you're probably doing something wrong. UNLESS, you're just that damn unlucky and every single one of your relative is a fucking asshole. I've heard of those stories before, so it isn't impossible - and I think that's the case with me. Jesus. For now, I'm playing the game they wanna play. They wanna be fake with me, I'll be fake with them. I act all fine and dandy around my mother and everyone else. I smile, I joke. All a facade. So when the right time comes, when I can finally burn bridges with them, **it will fucking hurt mom.** Mom, yes. Because everyone else would be glad I'm gone. But, my mother, will hopefully finally realize her fucking mistake and die a fucking failure of a mother.

"I just feel trapped I'm finishing up my Masters degree and just feel hopeless right now. I hate school. I'm starting to hate my field of study too. I play the trumpet. But to be honest, I'm not very good at it. High notes, any other trumpet player will be able to understand. In the past two years, my playing has underwent some other terrible thing where I hesitate at the start of anything I play. It's 100 percent mental. I've made some strides in it, but it still comes back. For the past two years, it has made me feel like I can't even play a simple fucking melody to someone if asked. Trumpet is basically my adventure, but it seems like I just cause myself pain. I want to keep working on it, but boy it hurts my soul to suck and to keep not doing well. On top of that, I struggle with my weight. I love fast food. I know it's bad, but I use it to cope. I also would love to stop watching porn. I'm addicted to that. I've been addicted to that since I was probably in the 4th grade. I just feel trapped, like I don't have the self control or am not smart enough to discipline myself to fix these problems. I'm just sick of being a loser in life. Is there any hope?

"Best moment to have anxiety It's 3:30am, I'm tired, want to get up early, and guess what ? My brain decided this : Instead of sleeping, why don't you become half crazy, thinking about your future (should I say the ""lack"" of future ?). Here, have some cravings for cigarettes, my pleasure, and of course i know you don't have cigarettes, do you think I'm stupid ? The middle of the night is the best moment for thinking of smoking when you can't smoke. Think of your loneliness. Think of you inexistant social life. You are 25 and you have no job. You are living with your boring mother, with whom you literally quarel with every day. She probably think you are a piece of shit. You never had any girlfriend, and you probably won't. Almost 26, don't count on me to congratulate you... Your only sunbeam will be at New year's Eve, when you will travel to see your best friends. But guess what, since you have no money at all, you probably will have to work to sell fu***ng pastries, and because of that you won't be able to see your friends. Then you'll continue to argue with your mother. Living on the couch. Selling pastries. In entire loneliness. God only knows how long. The funny thing (say my brain) is this : ""you are a loser, you lived and worked on your own not so long ago. But you are a child, you have the power to do what you want, where you want. You're 25, for God's sake, so why don't you move your ass ?"" Leave me alone brain, I already know all that. I would be a king if I could. But I won't. Funny how despair can suck the marrow of your life, how even when you are ready to fall in the deepest pit, you have absolutely no will to catch the rope. TL ; DR : FML.

"Weird Dreams So I have this issue I keep dreaming about sexual relations with my Sister in Law. Trust me when I say I love my wife and actually consider her sister to be a good friend and almost like a sister. Although these last couple of dreams I've dreamt my Sister in law naked or us doing things and I feel weird when I wake up after. Now yes she is an attractive woman but I don't see her that way at all. Does this make me a bad Husband or is there some scientific thing behind this???? Please help cause I can't even talk to her sister without feeling weird or remembering her naked. Also which I've never seen her naked at all in case that becomes a question.

"I feel like I'm dead already. Nothing gives me joy anymore, but I'm perfectly able to feel every negative emotion that's there. I feel like I'm wasting everyone's time. Basically it doesn't matter whether I'm around or not because I don't get anything out of it. I can't enjoy shit anymore. I don't wanna exist anymore. I feel like dying would be the best solution for everyone. but last night, for the first time, I felt like I could end it myself. it was enough, my emotions pushed me to the thought of actually doing it. I'm not afraid, I'm kind of glad that maybe there will be an end to all of this, maybe I can overcome my extreme guilt and end it myself one day.

"She stopped texting back Hi, i'm 19 and for as long as I remember I have always struggled with self-confidence and my depression. I rarely use tinder because I don't match with many people, I'm below average looking like but it doesn't help swiping for ages and rarely getting a match. I know it's just a glorified hook up app for the most part but the other night I matched with a really cute girl who was way out of my league and we started talking, one thing leads to another and next thing I know we're up to after 2am talking about PokÃ©mon of all things. I feel like there's a connection there so i ask her out and she says yes. It took alot to do this and it honestly made my month as the last few have been pretty meh. We kept talking the next day and that evening she didn't reply to one my texts, I tried to think nothing of it because it wasn't really a question or anything and tried to restart the conversation but nothing again. This morning I said Hi and she replied Hey back and then I asked her what she was up to and she just didn't reply again. I don't blame her if she isn't interested, that's fair enough it happens. She was sending x's up until she stopped texting back though and its not something i thought i was being naive about thinking she was interested in me but maybe i was wrong. I kinda just wish i knew where i went wrong. I just feel so unattractive and like there's something wrong with me. I know this probably sounds really petty and unimportant but it really hurts and I just needed to vent.

"Friend dumps problems on me and thatâs all we do together now Interested in other peoples experience of this and suggestions! Have been friends with a woman for a few years. Started off fun, weâd go for lunch, gigs and talk about a whole range of topics in person and by text. For the last 6 months sheâs stopped meeting up with me and responding to messages (or sending any). Instead she calls me at least once every week for often 2 - 3 hours asking for advice about men, her job and other stresses. Sheâll talk for over 20 mins uninterrupted, wonât stop talking when I need to go and will call even if Iâve said Iâll be out or unavailable. I got married oversees recently and our conversation was 10 mins on this and the remaining 2 hours about her problems. She gets aggressive if I donât offer a solution but when I cave and suggest another way of looking at things she throws it back in my face. She will often cite conversations with others where sheâs gotten into an argument, and for hours will push me to give an opinion as to what she did wrong and when I diplomatically suggest doing something different or how maybe the other person didnât mean it how it came across she will say I donât defend her and make passive aggressive remarks. Sheâll ask me to make decisions and then complains of it doesnât give her the result she wanted! Itâs confusing and really draining. Not mention all the fun parts of our friendship have slipped away and now Iâm left with her constantly calling. If I donât pick up she just keep ringing everyday! In fact I moved House once and she complained she had withdrawals from our calls. Feel pretty used as she has little to no consideration of my feelings or boundaries. In fact once on a call with her I received a text saying my grandmother had died, she just said she had to go and never mentioned it again, not even to ask how I was doing. Would you say anything or just cut ties given how sensitive she seems?

"Is it bad that I am kind of mad my friend never follows my advice? The friend in question and I have been friends for over 7 years and best friends for the last 3 years and have shared just about every detail of our life. I am a very observant person and have seen many repetitions in her behavior over the last years. The heading is a bit misleading here. I am not mad at her that she doesnât follow my advice. Rather, I am somewhat annoyed that she keeps making the same mistakes with the same toxic people in her life. I have been telling her that many of the people she surrounds herself with are very manipulative and are using her in one way of another as she has actually realized that, however she canât seem to actually do anything about this and keeps sacrificing her own needs to satisfy those of the people around her. This doesnât just happen once or twice, but it happens almost on a daily basis and I can basically feel her mental stability deteriorating. I have been telling her for forever that she should focus on her personal growth and leave the toxic people in her life behind. I know that that is super hard to do and super easy to says and that you canât follow that super easily and I have been trying very hard to be as supportive as I can and listen to her and be a shoulder to cry on. But itâs also very hard to see her being hurt over and over again by the same type of people or even the same person when there is a solution to the problem. And it seems like she isnât learning and instead she is just getting more and more insecure and anxious and her panic attacks are increasing in frequency because of these people. And it also makes me very anxious when I constantly worry about her. But I donât want to guilt or manipulate her into any decisions. And I donât know what to do. help pls im desperate.

"Really struggling with self image - any tips to build self confidence? I have struggled with my overall view of myself for as long as I can remember - in particular with my weight. Where im at, at the moment feels like the worst its ever been, I keep having full blown melt downs about how much I repulse myself. Throughout my life Ive been on more diets than I can count and tried multiple different excercise routines. About 4 years ago I gained 30kgs really fast and after moping and feeling sorry for myself i decided i would kick it up a notch and started taking things really serious. 6 days a week at the gym, personal training, strict meal plans - the works. This worked so well at the beginning, I dropped 18kgs in the first few months. It came to a halt and for the past 3 years I've continued to lose weight slower - im at about 25 kilos down in total now. I thought I would be further along by now. I live and work on the road at the moment travelling from town to town so ive dropped the gym membership but I try and make up for it with doing workout sessions on my own, lots of hiking and swimming. I recently switched to a keto diet from the previous meal plan I was on. I am fitter than I have ever been and what I can achieve now in a physical capacity is so much greater than ever before in my life (I was less fit even as a child) The problem I have is that im still so overweight, I very rarely find anything that fits me in stores and i dont have an address to order things online. I feel like people could look at me and assume I dont give a fuck about my health when I do and that makes me feel worse. Anytime I talk to doctors about unrelated issues they make it about my weight. I feel like outwardly im the worst version of myself, I look in the mirror and get angry. Does anyone have any tips on how to pull myself out of this? I feel so crushed when I'm reminded of my weight because I dont feel how I look. I want to be proud of my achievements but I'm not, I feel annoyed that its not better and I havent reached a bigger goal. I think ill never reach a weight I'm happy with - which is not only devastating to me but bothers me so much more because im genuinely trying my hardest. Ive had hiccups and times where I've literally tried to eat my feelings away but I always pick myself up and try again. I dont know how many more times I can fail. In an effort to help me stay on track my partner started eating the same foods as me. Weightloss had never been his goal or something he was focusing on, it was just to make it easier on me not to see him eating a toasted cheese sandwich while I was eating salad with no dressing. He wanted to limit the temptation and helped cook me awesome healthy meals that tasted a million times better than anything I cooked. For him it worked a treat, he was never overweight just a bit stocky, but hes since lost so much weight and looks amazing. And whilst im so happy for him it hurts as it just shows how much progress i havent made. As stupid as it sounds I think it highlights my weight more when we're together cause he looks so fit and healthy and I look like I sit around eating kfc all day. I want to be confident or at least more confident but I'm so critical on myself I cant even begin to let the confidence through. Any thoughts on this are appreciated and thankyou to anyone who took the time to read this.

"Long text, I just want an audience. Why havenât I killed myself yet? Itâs not the title, but a question that lingers on the back of my head every second. Itâs a common trend that people live for other people but what do you do when you have no one to live for? I never had anyone to live for. Itâs not a huge problem really, its another lingering question or jealousy I have whenever I meet a person. Every single one of them have someone who cares for them, even a stranger would care for them. It makes me feel jealous that no one would care for me or even bother to be nice to me unless I open my mouth and say I have cancer or they knew about any of my situation. People donât care, they pity me. They realize, then, that Iâm a hopeless situation and they canât help me at all because they really canât. No one can. Therapies donât help. My therapist knows all of my situations are out of my control and he wants me to move forward with my life. Itâs not really a bad idea, itâs the smart thing to do especially being someone in my situation. I just donât know why I canât. Every single being on the planet wants me to graduate already but my body doesnât agree with me. Itâs always either Iâm too sad/ stressed/ depressed/ ashamed/ anxious/ lazy to go to school. Nothing helps. Not even the 30mg of Lexapro helps. My school counsellor is doing the nice âI get it, I understandâ approach with me and it makes me feel better but it really does make me feel guilty. I just donât understand why are people act so shitty with me? Is it my face? Is it because no one cares and all I have is literally myself? Is it because Iâm dying soon? What is it really? I just want to fucking die but I cant just let myself slash my throat or swallow a lot of pills because Iâm a coward. I want the easy way out. Why isnât cancer an instant death? Why arenât suicide booths similar to futurama a thing? I give up. I just want to die. P.S. Fuck people who say theyâre afraid of rejection because hunty what world do u fucking live in that not one single person has said no to you? P.P.S. Fuck you E, Iâm sorry I disappointed you that I didnât die yet even my diagnosisâ average life span is 6 months. Donât worry, itâs coming. And I surely fucking hope karma is real. Itâs fucking people like you who deserve such things and what do you fucking get? A nice family, a handsome face, people who likes to be around you. Youâre one of the people who deserve my revenge and yet Iâm being like a pussy who is letting a fake thing called âkarmaâ take care of everything. In this fucking lifetime, not a single one got any karma. (or maybe my parents did by god giving me cancer but idk they just labelled me as a liability and now has dropped me like a hot potato so thatâs really more on me than on them) PLEAAAAAAAAAAAASE I just want to die. Please just kill me.

"I am lost. I do not know what to do. Hey guys. This is my first post here, I made this account because I need to vent and I have no one else to listen to me. To an outsider, my life seems okay: I am married to a great guy, I have a good job that pays well, my family is healthy and I have friends. To me, my life is unbearable. I am not ungrateful and I really do appreciate everything that I have in my life, but it is very hard for me to get out of bed in the morning and live out my day. One of my main problems is my weight. I know this may seem vain to some of you, but it is a huge problem for me, someone who already struggles with low self esteem. I have gained about 15 lbs in a year, and I cannot control what I eat, nor can I motivate myself to work out. I do not recognize myself anymore, none of my old clothes fit, and I can't seem to be able to do anything about it. Every day, I tell myself, I will eat healthy, I will make better decisions, I will not hate myself, I will not speak down to myself, etc... Each and every day, I fail. This kills me. My second problem is that I have a well paying job but it is very stressful and demanding. It takes up the majority of my day and this stress feeds into my poor eating habits. I have considered quitting but I cannot justify saying no to the money. I am scared that if I quit to try to focus on myself, I will just eat more and more because I will be less busy. I am a lazy, unmotivated person who is notorious for making excuses for herself. I really need some guidance. I hate waking up. I hate getting out of bed. I do not even want to shower or function. I don't know what to do.

"Tomorrow the world will go on like always I've never been here... this wasn't a part of ""the plan"" but I said why not leave something somewhere since no one else will be receiving anything. I have lived 20 years by myself, no relationships, no close friends, and the memories of being taken advantage of in my youth haunt me day in and day out. I run away through drugs but my depression is beginning to break through my facade of confidence. No one knows who I am and even if presented with a companion I don't know if I could ever explain the scars. I hate who I am and how I act, I feel though it's not even me. Social anxiety makes me act in ways I can't even understand and the repetition of ""I'm okay"" is getting old. I've tried to make friends but no one seems to want to know me and it's left me feeling like a sociopath. Insanity overcomes me as I scream, clenching a blade that can no longer quiet my mind. I've tried so hard to not be ignorant or selfish but I can't handle this anymore. The need of hospitalizations and psychologists remind me of the freak I am. I strive for perfection but am the opposite of it. I have so much love that I want to express but have no place to put it. I was raised religious but have so many doubts, my problem maybe isn't ignorance but overthinking, I hope... Nobody seems to understand subjectivity/relativity. There is much to be said but this will probably find its own void. I'm dreaming of a different world, but the oblivion of what I don't know plagues me. I leave my love and peace here, may you find yours. ""...because this is how things ought to have been and I know the worst of it wasn't all that it seemed, why can't I dream? do I care to dream...""

I think she may have only gone in an effort to save our marriage rather than herself. She's gotten new meds and this has happened over about 6mo. Last night I found a long search history of methods of suicide and I found a suicide note post dated a month from now. She's giving enough time to prepare everything. I'm not sure what to do. I plan on having a sort of intervention with her friend, mom my and hers to pursuade her to go to the hospital voluntarily, which I don't think shell do. Idk what to do. Idk what to tell my kids or how to handle any of this.

"Therapy didn't work for me at all. As long as I can remember I have been depressed, and have been thinking about killing myself. Last year it got to the point where I decided I needed to try therapy. I went for a while, but there was no improvement. During this period I just got worse and worse until I stopped going. I wish it would have worked, but it didn't. I want to try it again, but since I am unemployed I can't afford it, and even if I could, I don't think I want to spend money on something that I doubt will help. I have no idea what to do. I keep getting worse...

"Apologizing to a family member ? Not sure if this is the right place to put this? If itâs not feel free to direct me! To sum it up, Iâve highly offended a family member of mine. I wrote this apology that I canât bring myself to send them. I kept telling them how much I wanted to see them and I even flew up to see everyone. When we were all seated at a restaurant I was having really bad anxiety and didnât really speak to anyone. He took this really personal and felt I came off as an asshole. I didnât know how to explain the anxiety part of things to him so I gave him a lame excuse about eating spoiled food the night before. While it was true it wasnât the reason I wasnât speaking to anyone. Then I had went to his house to try and speak to him as I was leaving the next day and he told me not to come. I did anyway and you can imagine that didnât end well at all. He wonât talk to me. I finally found the courage to type up this apology. It explains the conditions I suffer from, how theyâre debilitating and the trauma I endured that caused them. The apology I feel is oversharing but I also wanted to explain myself in full and be as genuine as I possibly can. Nobody knows the things I went through but Iâm going to post the apology here for you guys to read for yourselves. Please donât judge me too harshly I just donât want this family member to never talk to me again. I understand it may come off as a pity me type of thing but I promise itâs not. Here it is : I just wanted to let you how sorry I am. I shouldâve apologized sooner but I wanted to give you time. Iâd like to fully explain myself. This is really long but itâs genuine. And Iâm not justifying myself in any way as I fully understand that Iâve crossed boundaries and disrespected you but I also want you to have a better understanding of what really happened. Hear me out before you roll your eyes at what Iâm about to say. Some of this wonât make any sense initially. But trust me it all ties together. Whatever decision you make Iâd prefer for you not to tell anyone any of this stuff. This is why I handled certain things the way I did. Iâve been through a lot of trauma. Initially it was with Savannahâs dad. He would beat me, kick me, slap, choke, etc told me my mother would be happy with me gone. And she was aware and didnât do anything. This was when Jody had custody of me but I was visiting them when they had an apartment together. Eventually I went to live with my dad and his parents. His mom didnât want any more kids and she was absolutely terrible to me. Sheâd give me Valium to sedate me, swing pots and pans at me, threaten me with knives, lock me out of the house etc. My dad wasnât any better as he gave me my first black eye. School was really difficult as Iâd get bullied pretty bad and Iâd get myself suspended just to avoid it. At this point people claimed I had a behavioral issue and I was put on multiple medications I didnât need. His mom was able to collect SSI because of this and when Jody found this out she wanted me back. After a year back and forth to court she won custody in January 2014. I was 15 at this point. She promised me a better life but it only got worse. She kept me locked up in the house for 4 years as she didnât want me improving and losing the SSI. Her boyfriend also lived there, he was an alcoholic. Heâd break into my room in the middle of the night to beat and rape me. Taunt me about how Iâve made previous suicide attempts and would go on about how heâd kill me but he figured Iâd do it myself anyway. Iâve never told anyone as I figured nobody would ever believe me. Anyway, I was diagnosed with depression, PTSD, Panic Disorder, and social anxiety, and yet most people arenât aware of a lot of the things Iâm telling you right now. Because of some of these conditions itâs hard for me to socialize with people for the first time. I wasnât trying to be distant or cold to you in person but my anxiety makes me seem that way and Iâm sorry. Itâs something Iâm trying to work on. In fact it was so bad at one point I wasnât even able to eat in a restaurant. I couldnât open the door if I ordered food. I was constantly living in fear of being injured, killed, judged, any situation I was faced with Iâd think of the worst possible scenario. Itâs even preventing me from getting a license. Now, when you said I was chatty in text and not in person it really hurt my feelings and I wanted to explain but how do I explain this to somebody? If I just said oh I have anxiety I felt as if it wouldâve sounded like bs. And I just felt absolutely terrible and I acted on an impulse and I just ended up disrespecting you and crossed boundaries I never shouldâve in the first place and I am so so sorry for that. Some of the things Aunt Connie said to me I took it to heart when I shouldnât have and it was another contributing factor as to why I had left. The spoiled meat story was true it wasnât a lie. I ate it around 1 in the morning she didnât give it to me I wasnât

"I News Your advice Hi, Iâm 18. my mom passed away three years ago, now I live with my dad whoâs a wonderful dad and I really love him but thereâs this situation that I donât know how to handle : He got involved into a sex club or something like 50 shades of gray, I donât know exactly what it is but I know that many women send him naked pictures and he is like a master, he tortures them sexually and they accept. I know heâs been involved with that for a long time, even when he was married with my mom, but he doesnât know I know all that. One day I asked him to answer me sincerely what was that, or just say nothing if he didnât want to. He lied to me but I said nothing. Today I found by mistake a bag of women underwear with panties in My home I left it open so heâll know I saw it. Should I confront him ? What should I say ? Iâm really scared ð

"Thoughts on multi-family and multi-generational households and family disagreements Basically, I married into a Filipino family, and my MIL owns a fairly large chunk of farmland. She routinely expresses a desire for ""all of us"" (myself, my wife, our two kids, my sister-in-law and her husband, my brother-in-law, his wife, and his kid) to build a large house with a large living area. Each of us (read: each family) would get our own rooms, everyone would live together, and we'd all be one big happy family. Except, not. I have a number of reasons for saying ""absolutely not"". Maybe it's my POV as someone that was raised in America, but I value independence and privacy. I want my own life, and my wife feels the same. Having family involved in everything you do, always having your kids being compared to other kids in the family, and always being treated like a child just sounds like hell. Not having the freedom to have sex or even choose what to have for dinner sounds like hell. No thanks. It's be really easy if her MIL wasn't a good person, but she is probably the most kindhearted person I've ever met. She's always there to help us out, financially or if we need anything else. We're there for her the best we can, too, of course. So it feels really bad to turn it down, especially since I understand enough about her culture to know that this would feel like a slap in the face. And there's the financial aspect, since the land is already family-owned. Acting disinterested doesn't work. Anyone else have family that has tried this?

"My life is so hollow Stupid self pitying rant, sorry. Nobody cares about my existence. Iâve never been and canât get into a relationship. Iâm stuck in this isolated suburb for the next 3 years of my life, drifting between my school and home. Usually I can occupy my mind with focusing on my looks or dreaming of the beautiful life iâm going to have once iâm free, but recently iâve been having to do more school work (iâm used to just stumbling through school without really focusing and getting above average grades but recently iâve been having to actually work to compete with my peers) and I either reject it to stay in my dream world or get 10 minutes in and break down because it gives me time to realise how hollow my life is. Nothing feels authentic when iâm here. There have been beautiful times in my life and 90% of them are when iâve been abroad. I just feel so genuinely empty whenever I give myself chance to look around and realise how isolated I am from people and the world. And as a person who truly appreciates the beauty of human beings and life, this really hurts me.

"Can/Should I send her a dm? Hi Iâll start this with some backstory. A friend of mine plays in a band and last weekend I watched them live for the first time, it was pretty small with four other bands and maybe 15 people watched my friends band. Anyway their lead singer is a girl who gave some weird vibes while on stage, but she was also very edgy so maybe it was that. After the concert someone showed me her IG and I thought Iâd follow her. She and approved me and followed back. The first post she made after that was pretty much this summarized: I am having a pretty bad phase of depression right now. I have no motivation, cant take compliments serious, hate everything I do and am overwhelmed with the smallest social interactions (there was more but Iâll stop here). I personally have been struggling for the past few weeks with similar issues again and thought if it was okay to send her a message along the lines of this or if it would be intrusive: Hey I saw your Post about your depression and can relate a lot to yo. I am a friend of guy and saw you live for the first time in city. I know how shit it feels to have phases like this and wonât say it becomes magically better, but you are doing an amazing job with your music. I know you donât know me and I donât know you, but if you want to talk to someone who comprehend what you are feeling, I would gladly do it. English isnât my first language so some things might sound rough, but I hope I was able to get my message across

"Why am I an idiot? I always feel the need to be loved by someone else. So I am constantly trying to talk to a girl and get a date. I actually went on a date recently. A couple weeks ago I hit it off with this girl from another school nearby and we had a lot in common. We vibed really well and seemed to have similar feelings for each other. We talked for a couple of weeks and then we went on a date. I think we both enjoyed ourselves but we didnât talk as often afterwards. I blame myself for that because I feel like I should have been more social with her. We donât talk anymore and I wish I still talked to her but it has been a weird amount of time since our date and I donât know how to go about it.

"I've always resented my mom for being emotionally abusive growing up and blamed her for my depression. But I just told her I'm depressed and she responded in the most perfect way. I feel really weird. I'm an adult now (24) and have had crippling depression since childhood. Growing up, I never had emotional support or love. I was called names and my mom took out her relationship/life issues on me. I was distant from both my parents. I've hugged my mom only once in my life. This is just one issue out of many that led to me developing a fragile self esteem and crippling depression. Over the years, with distance, we started to talk- like once a month or so. The more educated I became, the more I came to understand why she acted the way she did (although I still harbor much resentment) I'm going through a depressive episode just now. I feel so alone and I texted her out of desperation. I told her I felt alone and depressed and couldn't get out of bed to study. Instead of judging me or saying something mean....she just listened to everything and all of my symptoms. She said that she felt so sorry for me and she wished she could help me. And she told me to never feel alone because she loves me and I'm very important to her. She asked if she could do anything to help me...and I realized, yeah, if we could call each other every morning, I could have someone to talk to and tell her about my daily goals. Then I could feel more motivated to get out of bed and feel less alone that day. I just feel weird, because I don't have a relationship with her. I'm scared it's going to be awkward, but I'm desperate for any support I can get right now. I also still resent her, but at the same time understand. I don't know. It's just weird. But, I'm happy she acted this way, for sure. Edit: I also don't mean to brag or anything like that. I just wanted to share this with someone, and was wondering if someone had a similar experience maybe in forming a bond with their parents longer into adulthood.

"Making friends... Literally one of the hardest things ever. If you haven't found a group in middle school, you literally have to make friends with everyone in the group. And then, entertain them and convince them you're interesting for literally a year on end. Then, I imagine you have a shot of getting invited somewhere. I'm not a fucking magician, I can't keep you entertained consistently for that long. And these people never reciprocate the effort you put in because they have a group and you don't. I gotta work 10 times as hard because I didn't get lucky in middle school like these guys... lol...

I know I'm young but thinking about the future makes me so anxious. The only thing I want is to be happy. My friends in school always rushed me about my career, they made fun of me because I didn't know what to study. I was the best in my class so they were surprised. I stopped talking to them because I was so ashamed about dropping out university. I started studying IT Engineer career but I couldn't take it. I feel like that wasn't for me. I'm afraid that I would never find something that I really like. Please don't judge me like them. I don't want to go outside, I don't want to people see me, I'm such a failure.

"Apologise and make up or move on? Sorry itâs long, but I really need advice. Iâm a girl and heâs a gay guy so thereâs definitely no feelings other than friendship. He only invites me to clubs occasionally, never to hang out. I felt used &amp; that he only invites me to pay for his drinks. Most of the time he ditches me to go off with random guys. One night I was going home early and he said âno youâre staying at mine tonightâ, but within half an hour met some guy and said he was going home with him instead- and that didnât even end up happening because the guy had a boyfriend, so he ditched me for no reason. He doesnât even text me, because apparently heâs a bad communicator. On the flip side he constantly refers to me as âone of his best friendsâ, tells me he loves me and wants me to be his maid of honour one day. He had a potential STI scare recently and asked if Iâd go to the clinic with him. I ran out of my house and across the city to sit with him for 4 hours, didnât even have time to brush my teeth! While we were waiting I told him this was the first time weâve hung out outside of a club, and he said âitâs not my fault Iâm busyâ. I didnât show it but I was really disappointed. Heâs a student (as am I), not the president. He hangs out with his other friends constantly, stays at their house for a week at a time OR MORE, but has the nerve to tell me heâs too busy for me. A week later he invited me to the club again and we left and walked to the bus stop together. He got on his bus and left me alone and drunk, again. Itâs also strange because heâd always invite me to stay at his after nights out, but that randomly stopped a couple of months ago. Anyway, this time I had enough and ignored his messages after that. He then invited me to the cinema and I said yes. On the day I saw that he was with his other friends instead. He called me at night and said he was âtired and sickâ but we could meet 2 days later. I just said âokâ because I didnât want to confront him and fall out. On the day we were meeting he text me at 5pm and asked âare you still up for the cinema?â and following advice from my friends, I said âno thanksâ and told him itâs unbelievable that after everything hes done he chose to blow off hanging out with me to hang out with other friends, and lied about it. I also said heâs not busy, heâs just a shit friend. He said he agrees that Iâm a better friend than him but he never hangs out with anyone sober and heâs trying his best. He said he was making an effort to match his actions to his words by spending time with me alone. I didnât reply. Itâs been 4 days and we havenât spoken since. Heâs been with his other friends the whole time and frankly I donât think heâs bothered. I know it sounds dramatic but Iâve barely slept since. Iâm only getting 3 hours of sleep a night and Iâm really sad and canât stop thinking about the situation. I thought we were gonna be friends forever. I love him and want him in my life but everyone says Iâve given him too many chances. Iâve been thinking about apologising and making up, if nothing else at least just so I can feel better and start sleeping again. But I donât know how it will be received or if anything will change. I donât know what to do but this situation is killing me and I regret causing it in the first place.

"Best friend of 12 years seems to be drifting When we were in middle/high school we were inseparable. I thought she was the most amazing person to ever walk the planet. She made me feel so smart, beautiful, special, etc...I loved her so much. We went through everything together during those times and when college came around, we went to different schools. I had to work 2 jobs to keep my head above water and couldn't always make the 4-hour drive to see her as often as I wanted. She also got into drugs, which was no issue with me, but since I was never into it, I stopped getting invites to places with her (probably due to the fact I always was ALWAYS working.) We both drifted a bit in college, but then afterward we (and our SO's) moved to the same city. I was so excited to finally have a better schedule and see her as often as I could. I told her how I found God after struggling with depression and anxiety and she immediately accused me of being homophobic because I said I was Christian (born again I guess, we both grew up Catholic). Which was severely not the case. She also accused me of being so different that it's like she doesn't even know who I am anymore. I let her vent about the drifting and the differences we both grew into since middle/ high school, without even mentioning to her that she was different too, it's called growing and changing as you age, but I still loved her just the same...then I expressed how I don't want to lose her over this and we eventually squashed the beef. I know she doesn't like my boyfriend of 5 years all that much, mainly because she thinks he changed me, not taking into account that I can make my own decisions and have my own thoughts that that nothing to do with my boyfriend's. 2 years go by and during those two years, her father passes away unexpectedly. He was the light in her life and it was so painful to see everything she went through during that time. I was there for her as often as she needed me and then some. Eventually, things started to feel really one-sided. I kept ignoring it because I knew she was grieving, but after almost 2 years, it was starting to get to me. My calls and texts were hardly received, she always seemed to be in a rush to talk to me, it felt like walking on eggshells. I guess now, what really bothers me is that a friend of hers is going through a hard time with her SO and my best friend has been extremely supportive and just going above and beyond with this other girl, while all I feel like I've received from her is criticism of my relationship, my values, my political views (which she really knows almost nothing about but assumes my position). As I write this, I'm actually getting angry at how much I've been there for her, but how little she has been there for me. I'm extremely scared to bring all this up to her because she is so critical and everything she says cuts deep. It's not a good feeling, but neither is this. I don't really know what to do, and I can't imagine losing her. I would hope I can work up the confidence to tell her how I'm feeling and we can have a rational conversation about it. But I just feel really stuck.

"My latest depression has a cure, and it's my girlfriend. So this is my story about a severe depression and anxiety I have been experiencing these months. TLDR, we kinda broke up back in April, we had some issues regarding me being a prick. But, she forgave me as we have a perfect relationship (that's right, I do think it's marvelous). But for some important reason that I don't wanna give details in, we can't be together anymore. So, I started having anxiety attacks, and all my world was like hell, it was so bad, I felt like I had to do something about it. Anyways, I am fighting to be back again with her, and she also is waiting for me. We all dream about things or situations where we would allegedly be happy with: money, being successful.. all that kind of stuff. Here's what I have learned: When I dream about all this stuff, at the end the only thing, I mean, my only desire, the only thing that I crave in this world, and which I would be crushed to not have, is her. I'm a person who deeply depends on others, I previously gave myself into deep friendships, but after all, and after all experience, my only friendship and relationship I'm keeping with is my girlfriend. She literally is my everything regarding my happiness, and me being alive. Here's the summary: I wanna go back with my girlfriend, and I am depressed and sad if I'm not with her. I know we'll be hopefully soon together, but as the meantime, I feel like my days are worthless and my life is meaningless.

"I die a little inside with every customer (TW) Let me start by saying I've been getting help for chronic depression and anxiety since January. I take sertraline (50mg) every day, and it's helped me tremendously. I was hired as a cashier at a fast food job in November of last year, and it was a huge step forward. No education, no GED, no transportation, no job experience (except for working for a family company since I was a literal child); needless to say, I felt like I overcame a hump that had been looming in front of me for quite some time. I've had extreme social anxiety since my early teens, so diving headfirst into a cashier job seemed a bit counter-intuitive. Now, I don't know if it was the medication or simply having no choice but to face my fears every day, but the anxiety has completely faded. Gone. Zilch. Good, right? Well, in its place, a little seedling sprouted, and as time goes by it swells inside my heart and head, pushes against my skull, crushes my organs, my spark, my will to move forward. I hate people so fucking much. I am so damn tired of hearing you complain that the price of a sandwich has increased by fifty fucking cents. I am so damn tired of cleaning up after your little brats after they throw their food on the floor. I am so fucking fed up with you cancelling an entire fucking order, after it was already prepared, because the soda machine was out of cherry Fanta. What the fuck is wrong with you? I go home and utterly dread the next day of picking up the slack of my coworkers and dealing with a shitload of entitled, spoiled assholes. Every now and then, there is an angel. Someone who isn't a total asshole to me...it could be something so small to you, but it can make my entire day that much easier. Perhaps you already know what you want to order, and don't hold up a line of ten people because you're picky as fuck. Perhaps you tip me 96 cents. Usually, it's treating me like I'm a feeling, thinking human instead of the shit on your heel. I bend over backwards for these people and do my best to let them know that they're truly appreciated. I've come so far, and yet I'm so close to giving up. It's wearisome forcing a smile every day and powering through as if I have a promising future, when I don't. I pretend that I don't slice my thighs with razors, that I'm not covered in self harm scars, that all is well. I pretend I don't fantasize every day about diving headfirst in front of a semi truck. I pretend the love of my life and best friend isn't homeless and isn't living in a tent with a heroin addict. I pretend, I pretend, I pretend. I am so tired.

"I think I am depressed but I am not sure I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me but I think I might have depression. 1) I love going out with friends. I am very active person, but lately for example even when I am laughin I suddenly stop and get very sad. I do not know what is wrong but I get very sad and I lose interest in doing everything. 2) Lately I can not focus. I have never been fun of doing homework but I was always doing it. Now I just can't I am just laying bad instead of doing homework. You might say I am been lazy but also I am music producer and I absolutely love music, but lately I just can't. When I sit down I just can't focus on it and I end up going to bad after 15 minutes. 3) I am sleepy all the time and I am sad most of the times. I do not have specific reasons but I am. 4) I became very insecure. It feel like my friend do not like me. I feel like they do not want me to be around them and I just do not know why. 5) Most of the times on weekdays I am just laying on my bad and listening sad music and I feel like I am wasting my time. Sorry I think I do not make any sense at all but rn I am feeling really bad and can't think properly.

"Whatâs wrong with me? I have an amazing family and an incredible group of friends. The support is there and theyâve tried to help in the past but I canât burden them with my troubles anymore, it just feels uncomfortable. Iâve seen a three therapists in my life each no more than two times. Iâm not sure why I canât just get myself to keep seeing one consistently. Iâm waiting on grades from summer school but Iâm fairly positive I failed and will subsequently be kicked out of college. Iâm 23 and still have over year left to go. I donât know where to turn. I donât know how to move forward. I canât sleep at night and during the day all I want to do is lay in bed. My productivity is at an all time low which is saying something, trust me. I feel like Iâve lost it. I think I hate myself.

"I really need help making friends I'm 25, living with my parents. I recently quit my job, hoping to ease my depression but it only made it worse since I have nothing to distract me now. I lost touch with all of my high school friends after graduation, and didn't make any friends in college. I spend my days walking my dog, reading wikipedia articles, youtube, etc. I haven't spoken to another person since Monday. I just stay in my room and my parents don't come in. I don't have any hobbies, not even video games so I don't even have ""online"" friends. I have no friends or anybody to talk to. I realize this isn't a healthy lifestyle, and that I'm a loser. But I want to change. How do I meet people and make friends? When I meet people, what do I talk about?

"So dramatic ðª My best friend and I were in the same school ever since we were 4 years old. But then, I had to leave for a different high school while she stayed with most of our friends. We didnât grow apart, but we spent most of our time with different people, which can change a person. Iâd like to think that I did not change a whole lot (probably true :â) ) but my best friend has been hanging out with some of our friends and theyâve been affecting her attitude in a way, and sheâs starting to become the same people we would always laugh at for being stupid and ignorant and petty. We talked about it and she agrees thatâs sheâs changed, but doesnât want her change to affect our friendship. What do you think we should do?

"My dad's mad after game night. My family and I were playing board games two nights ago. We finished the first one which went well, it was fun. We switched to the second game that 4/6 of us had played before. After my brother finished explaining the rules my dad (who has played before) asked a really stupid question, so we thought he was joking. He then got really mad while we were answering his question, got up, and said he's not playing anymore. The next day we didn't say anything to each other. Today, we still haven't said anything to each other and he's clearly mad. Should i say something to him or let it pass?

"My goal in life is to finally feel safe I'm at my boyfriends house. Been here a few days. I stay here every so often to escape my unstable home life, and hes all I have. I got a call from my dad. My childhood dog had to be putdown. Bone issues. Everytime I think of anything that gives me anxiety I feel the need to pick at my skin. My face is red and scabbed. I dissapoint everyone because I was the one destined to be smart and be the first (family name) with a degree and stable job. I turn 18 next month. No job experience. I get my photo id next week. Its very late because my parents lost my birth certificate. Set me back a lot. My mum is suddenly rushing for me to get Centrelink (welfare), so she can take half of each payment. We barely have food in the house most days because she uses her welfare on cigs and bills. I feel like I do nothing. Everyday is just nothing. In bed, video games, browsing internet, sex, video games, sad music and alcohol. Rinse and repeat. No joy. I want a social life and a hobby. I want a job. I want to not feel like im just laying down while everything falls apart on top of me. I want to feel safe and happy and like I give back and help people. I dont want to waste my life. I dont know why but I keep feeling like I'm going to die soon. I dont want to but its in my head. I dont want anxiety and i dont want to be pathetic and i dont want to be scared and i dont want to be bored and i dont want people hate me and i want to know what to do

"4 years Tuesday Tuesday will be the four year anniversary of when my dad committed suicide. My 21st birthday was this weekend and I got pretty drunk and started to think about it and I just cried and cried in the Uber with my friends. Iâm really thankful for them. But there isnât a day that goes by that I donât think about him. The thing is, he was an asshole. To me and my mom. I didnât know he was depressed, I just thought he was mean and didnât love me. I really do think I couldâve prevented it if Iâd known. Iâve been extremely depressed ever since it happened. I donât think Iâll ever be normal again.

"Feeling trapped in my head First off I'm Autistic, I'm studying at Oxford I'm struggling to remember anything, like anything at all, people, faces, dates, facts, etc. I'm feeling more and more alone because I don't feel like I have anything good to think about. I have a girlfriend, she's in the forces and has a lot of structure and meaning to her life and I like that but I see my life as completely pointless. So about a year I was cycling in the dark and I was hit by a car, I flew over the bonnet and hit my head. I was out for about half an hour, till I regained conscience in the back of an ambulance, and the crews were cutting off my clothes and pumping me full of morphine. Before this accident I had a very good memory, and my parent would say I could talk about anything that had happened from when I was a child. I was having some weird relationships at the time with different people, and I only came out to them after I was in hospital for a month after the accident, I didn't want to say anything because I didn't want to worry them. I valued their feeling more over my own life, and I still do that now with other people. Things started to crash after the accident, I lost people really good friends and I knew it was me, and I changed and something during that accident had altered me, and I hated it. I started to forget people very quickly and events that had happened and horribly people who had died and continuously not realising they had died. That upset a lot of people. Before everything happened I had broken up with a girl (but i didn't realise that after), now I can't remember what we did together or even how we met, but I can't get the thought of her out my head, she later told me to leave never come back, which I did. But even now I still have the feeling of thought of her, and I'm struggling to get rid of that, I don't love her and I'm not in love her, I just feel like i'm obsessed with her a person I know nothing about and It haunts me. I've been to a few separate doctors and have been recommended medication, which I believe it has just made it worse. I've talk to my parents but they just talk highly of the pro's of medication and councillors. Hate councillors. (I always ended up lying to them) Since everything I've had some real down point, and made two attempts, by failed due to people walking in randomly either whilst in progress or while setting up. I've already made necessary precautions by writing letters, addressing them and stamping them but non have been sent. I want to tell my gf but I feel like, I don't want to throw feelings away by her thinking 'he's a sobbing kid, or he's crazy or why am I with him' - I'd rather hide it not to upset her, people mean everything in the world to me, and I'd give my life for her, any day. But I still want to tell her, and I don't her to be scared of me. When I close my eyes and think of a memory, I just see grey mist or static like of a television. It doesn't feel nice not having anything to fall back on in your mind, things that made you happy.

"Cried in a bathroom stall I'm not the type to post this kind of things, but I hate myself. I try my best to socialize, to be emphatic but I end up here every single time. Alone, boring and fucking depressed. Sometimes I think maybe I should be dead instead of someone else who had way better success at life than I did. I hate feeling this way and I take it out on my family when I can't control it. No matter how hard I try, socially I get nowhere, no friends, no relationships and no happiness. So here I am, if you guys know any sort of assassin hit me up, I might actually pay you to take me out. Save me the trouble of doing it myself. Peace out.

"I guess Iâm done with her? Or is there something wrong with my attitude? So, in the Literature class, we did a practice exam paper and we had a peer assessment. One of my friend had my paper and it turns out she graded mine the lowest in the class. The teacher was actually surprised on her harsh mark and said jokingly âHey, he (me) did all right. Isnât that too harsh?. Later I approached to her to ask what was it that she gave mine a low grade. Then, she rants out all the things Iâve done wrong, but she spoke so fast that I couldnât quite catch all of them. And I became a bit angry at her attitude because 1. She spoke so fast (so I couldnât quite catch 30% of her points) which is likely to be intentional so Iâm startled before I can argue back. 2. Majority of her points were about that I lacked explicit points, but the teacher ticked all the points and said they were explicit enough? So, I said back to her âHey but the teacher said the essay was all rightâ She scoffs and says: âYeah, write like that in the real exam and you will totally pass. Who are you kidding?â Now I wouldnât really complain if she actually gave me valid constructive criticism, but she spoke so fast (likely to be intentionally) and most of her points came from simply her not reading carefully enough.. BTW, she actually achieves better grades than I do and is clearly smarter than I am. Not trying to be boastful, but in this Literature class, I really think itâs safe to say that I get better grades than her most of the times. And, sheâs not a teacher. What the hell does she know better than the teacher to say things like that, especially when she gets lower grades than I do most of the time??? Besides, she really always says rude things in front of someoneâs faces (and many many times in front of my face).. and sheâs sometimes in her own world and can get really arrogant and cynical. I guess Iâm done with her right? Or is there something wrong with my attitude? I regretted a couple of times being friend with her in the first place, and now I really see that there can be no good staying with her. And, I'm in my final year before graduation... I feel quite embarrassed that I'm complaining about this kind of friendship problem and I know I should be focusing on studying, but thinking about this gets me angry every time.

"Are my friends leaving me out on purpose? This has been bugging me for a while, I mean I've gotten to the point where I've made a Reddit account to vent about it. So I'm on of those girls who has two best friends, I'm sure you can already see where this is headed (I'll call them Susie and Amy). When I started secondary school I didn't have any friends since I had joined out with my school catchment area. Although, I met Susie and she quickly became my best friend. We were in a big group of girls which included Amy. Amy and Susie had become close since they lived near each other and had had lots of sleepovers and days out together and stuff. I had made friends with a girl called Ruby who was Amy's best friend at the time and eventually Amy and Ruby fell out, causing the group to split up and because I was closer to Susie, I went with her. This left Amy, Susie, and I to form a little ""squad"" and the three of us were extremely close for the next three years. Some things happened with Susie which resulted in Amy and I falling out with her for about 10 months. Nothing big, just usual girly bitching and drama. Amy and I became extremely close during this time but something Amy told me really hurt. When we were in the process of making up with Susie, Susie had told Amy that she considered Amy to be the closest person to her. That couldn't be right? I went to Susie's house every Friday? I helped her out with her chores whenever I was over, I stayed over almost every weekend, I went on trips with her and her family all the time, we sat next to each other in almost every class, we constantly texted and called and she wouldn't hesitate to tell me every detail of her life and problems and neither would I. Amy had a job and was always working weekends, she was also never the type to text people or even call since she was always with her sister. So why did Susie consider her closer? It really stung but I got over it. My issue now is that since the three of us have made up I can't help but feel a little excluded. I'll only give one example since everything's of a similar nature. We've been off school for the past three days because of the snow. I saw that Susie was at Amy's house on the first day, I was a little bummed about not being invited but I brushed it off since it could've just been a spontaneous visit. But Susie is at Amy's Mothers house today, I'm assuming she's staying over, and it's not like I live an hour away. I live a 15 minute walk away, it would only take 5 minutes to get a lift there and the snow isn't bad anymore. So...did I do something to warrant not being invited? Usually Amy would always invite me over, we would have loads of sleepovers... And y'know to top it all off, my Grandma passed away on Tuesday, Susie had met my grandma and visited her with me a lot and even though I had told her what happened she messaged me later to ask why I seemed sad, only to act shocked and say she 'never realised' that my grandma had died even though I had already told her. Amy knew my grandma had died too but she hasn't said a word to cheer me up. These girls aren't awkward or unsympathetic either, they've taken care of me when someone has passed away before. Are they being like this on purpose? TL;DR Close friends I've had for years are excluding me, is it on purpose or by accident?

"Religious difference between you and your child? Hi everyone! I am a doctoral student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and am conducting a research study on the experience of religious difference between parents and children.

"Mother is always trying to start something. My mom and I have a rocky relationship, I love my mom but sometimes I absolutely cannot stand her or the things she does. It stems from her depression that she has, but she always blames everything in the world for her problems and never herself. Yesterday, she texted me that my grandparents were moving from our hometown they've lived in since the 80's and to the town where more of our family lives. I sent a picture of my discount card from my job and said they could use it if they needed to buy boxes or moving supplies. She replied with ""That's it no emotion?"" Should I have been more emotional to the situation? I don't blame my grandparents for moving because I moved out of state last year. I don't care what my grandparents decide to do because it's their decision to move. I don't blame them for moving at all.

"How to end a friendship Hello I have two good friends male (27) and female (27) who are in a relationship with each other. We have been friends for almost 7 years now. 2 years ago, I (26) started dating my current bf (35). During that time, I was playing hard to get, and I was not really interested in my bf at the time so I would talk about him to my male friend who is in the relationship with my other friend. At one point, my friend told me that my bf is a sucker for love because he was chasing a girl that didn't want him...fastfoward...I accidentally told my bf that my friend called him a sucker and my bf said he doesn't want me being friends with him anymore. When my friend and I spoke about my bf, my bf and I were just dating, we were not bf and gf so I don't think my bf should taken it to the extent that I shouldnt be friends with him. Regardless....the point is that idk how to tell my friend that I can't be friends with him anymore...and if I'm not friends with him than his gf, which is my friend too, is not going to be my friends anymore...I feel bad because they are always asking to go out with us but they don't know the arguments I had with my bf regarding this matter. I feel stuck in this situation and I need your assistance. Thanks

"Sometimes I worry I let my mental illness be my excuse? It feels easy to justify staying up late, not eating properly... Not going out or not doing xyz; because I'm unwell. It feels impossible to differentiate between me being unwell and me not using it as an excuse.

I've no way to tell really. I think I've been depressed so long now that I can't even remember what normal is. Or tell if my changes in character are related to being unwell or to me changing.

"Finding it difficult after college Hi. Im 23 and lately I've lost interest in everything. It kinda started last semester, I finished my masters and missed out on a 1.1 from a bad assignment, can't find any jobs relating to my degree and am currently stuck in a miserable retail job. Since the new year started everything has been getting tougher. I've been applying for PhDs, science jobs and anything that i could use my degree for, and everything Ive applied for I've been rejected from. My supervisor I was applying for scholarships with has kinda just abandoned me because I was declined from a competitive scholarship he wanted his project funded for. I feel like everything relates back that I narrowly missed out on my top grade so I'm basically an idiot. Since then I'm in a retail job where I get shouted at by customers every day. My roommate and best friend landed me saying she was leaving our apartment and ringing the landlord-literally out of nowhere-, so I've to leave the city and move back home. I've been prescribed antidepressants before but I found that they made me feel worse and I couldn't stay on them. I feel like I'm just stuck in a rut and I'll never get out. All my friends are either in phds or jobs that they like and I'm the only one in a miserable job. I've applied for another masters, the one I initially wanted before I got accepted into the one I degreed in, but I feel like it's just a waste of time. I have a family that loves me and a boyfriend and a few good friends I know care but I just find myself thinking that theyd be happier if I wasn't around. Everything I've tried to do has just been a failure and I've just lost interest in life. Some days I really don't want to leave my bed and just lie there because I'm just going to fail again. Sorry for the rant. TL:DR: finding myself in a rut I just can't get out of and have lost interest in life

"I am so fucking unbearably lonely I have no job, no friends. and nothing even close to an SO. I've never even been on a date. That's a pipe dream of course I wouldn't date someone as disgusting as me so why should anyone else in the first place. But I can't stop desperately wanting to be loved, to be touched. not even sexually necessarily tho that too, but just be held, kissed. Anyone, I don't give a fuck anymore boy or girl just someone anyone please It's never happened and it feels like it never will. I feel like I'm starving to death. I can't shake this need I've never really felt before and it's every damn minute. it's so damn funny though I shrink away from even the slightest of contact with another human, in the rare occasion I'm in public I bury myself in my phone and hope desperately no one acknowledges me. no one ever does but I'm always still afraid they will. how fucking pathetic, isn't it. add this to the list of things that make me wanna rip my skin open

"Bad Stepmom? I was married for 17 years to a man who refused to work and who sat and watched TV all day. I divorced him to find a better situation. I married my current husband on Sept 1, 2017. On 10/6/17 he lost his job. Now I feel as if I'm back where I started. I have to pay for everything. On top of it, he invited his 18-year-old daughter to move in with us without asking me, even though I'm paying for everything. Suddenly I'm paying for her groceries and everything else on top of his. Then, I'm informed by my husband that his daughter's boyfriend is going to spend every weekend here: Friday night through Sunday afternoon. Now I'm feeding him too. To make matters worse, the daughter and her boyfriend are loud and inconsiderate. They leave messes in the kitchen, living room, her room, etc. I miss my quiet house. Paying for him and I is more than enough. Am I selfish to not want to support her and her boyfriend too? I have a house in a different city but he refused to move there because my young adult kids live there.

I wasn't meant to exist so why am I here? If I wasn't here maybe my parents could've bought a house instead of renting their whole life. Maybe buy a car that the bumper doesn't fall off on.

"I will never be able to take care of myself, let alone anyone else. I physically can't find the energy to even do the most basic things, like laundry, showering, and eating. Grocery shopping is a really tiring adventure that is followed by a four hour nap. My schoolwork to rest ratio is 1:10. I can't even remember to water the singular plant that I own. They always end up dying before I even realize. I don't even know how I'd be able to take care of a pet, let alone any kids. It's a really good thing I don't want kids, because I'd be a terrible, neglectful mother. I'd hardly have any energy to make them food, let alone entertain them. I don't understand how people can clean and do laundry and brush their teeth every day. They're mountains to me.

"Advice please. Am I in the wrong or is she overreacting? This is going to be a long post! This is my very first post! Me (F33) and, now ex best friend (F33) just had a major falling out and sheâs blaming me. Hereâs a little backstory; We were best friends, did everything together, babysat each others kids and just hung out all the time. I have 5 kids, she has 2. My youngest are 19 month twins, her youngest is 9 month old girl. I babysat last for her on Nov 1st. Before dropping her baby off, I always vacuumed because she spent all of her time on the floor. Nothing dangerous in her reach (obviously, I Baby proofed for my kids). She was rolling around and got over by my shoe rack and found something I didnât see and, like babies do, she stuck it in her mouth. I went over to her and did a finger sweep to remove it but I couldnât get it and it made her gag; not choke, gag. So I angled her down, patted her back and it fell out. She smiled at me when I turned her right side up, obviously unfazed by what just happened. I stayed calm, and did what needed to be done, no harm. Told mom about it and she seemed unfazed as well and stayed and chatted and left shortly after. Thought everything was fine until just a few nights ago. She sends me a text; thatâs right, a text, and basically tells me that I can no longer be trusted to watch her kids and that the state of my house shouldâve been a red flag. (My house is lived in, not a pig sty). She said I dropped the ball and let her kid stick something in her mouth and she couldâve choked. Also, I was so nonchalant about telling her about it and that means I was lazy and didnât see it as a big deal. News flash- it wasnât a big deal, nothing happened. She said she wants me to apologize for putting her daughters safety at risk and that basically this friendship is over. Iâm sorry but if itâs safe enough for my twins itâs safe enough for her daughter. She found something that I couldnât see from my view point and stuck it in her mouth. I stayed calm, responded and everything was fine. Should I apologize? Did I do something wrong? She is refusing to talk to me face to face. I donât feel like I should apologize for something every baby does. I just canât believe she held onto this for so long. Weâve even hung out since then and she never said anything. Just some advice please.

"Can depression impede articulacy? Obligatory I've been living with depression (BP2) and anxiety for much of my life as a young adult. It's been stronger than it ever has the past year and a half, and I've noticed many things about myself that aren't in line with who I thought I once was. One of the most significant is how I sound to myself and others. I used to actively attempt to expand my vocabulary as well as possess an ability to articulate my thoughts, but it seems these days, I'm just drawing blanks most of the time. I feel like an idiot and inferior to others.

"Does Trading Help Your Depression? Maybe I am a bit weird in this regard, but I do quiet well in this regard. I have not traded too much because of life circumstances, and thus the past few years have been depressed, as my one best friend is in jail and the other has adopted asceticism. I also moved to a new area and broke up with my ex. I have been thinking stuff over, and even though winning at coding can make me slightly happy, I feel like whenever I am trading I am on fire and feel like my ""true"" self, whereas otherwise I feel blah. When I mean trading I mean medium term investing based on value investing. IDK if the risk and reward part overruns me, but when I think about that I don't think about my lack of dating or how this or that sucks, I focus on kicking ass and taking names. Anyone else ever get a feeling like that? IDK if this is taking on risky behavior for the sake of it or merely finding my muse.

I don't really know how to start this, since I'm kind of new to this subreddit, and reddit in general, but I guess I'll try to say this all without embarrassing myself or something of the sort. Lately, I've just been having a tough time, especially since it's the last week before exams in my school. I don't feel any pressure to be doing well at studies anymore, but I do have one friend who *does,* and occasionally, he'll ask for space or something during stressful times so that he doesn't end up lashing out at me, but now, it's just making me feel incredibly lonely. I hate having to watch everyone else give hugs and stuff and just have a good time with their friends while I just keep having to give my friend space. I get that we put this in place to avoid having feelings hurt, but now it just feels... restrictive? It's all kind of hard to describe coherently, and my mind feels all jumbled up, tbh. I just really want a hug at this point so i can stop feeling... well, lonely...

I mean if this is all im gonna be as a person even after all this hard work... what's the point. At the end of the day the only thing i really end up looking forward to is sleeping.

Is it worth it to continue working as hard as i do at Work? All I ever do is get shafted or picked on. What about going to therapy, is it worth it to keep going?

"I need help Please help, I donât know whatâs happening and I canât control my emotions. Iâm losing it. I went to my momâs house and when I got there, there were guests staying over that I didnât know. I have very severe social anxiety so this is not good. When I called my mom before driving to her house, she specifically said that no guests were over and it was okay to come. She lied. I went inside the house and asked my mom about the guests, she told me that she intentially lied to me because she wanted me to come over and knew that I wasnât going to come over if there were guests there. I freaked out. My mom completely disrespected my boundaries and said the equivalent of âfuck your social anxiety, do what I wantâ I quickly left the house and went back into my car. I wanted to leave there because I knew I couldnât handle socializing with other people. However, my mom followed me back into my car and started to ask why I was leaving. I tell her that she lied to me and I canât take deal with my social anxiety. She says she doesnât believe my social anxiety is real (mind you, Iâve spent two month in a psychiatric hospital last year) and says she wants me to stay. I tell her fuck off and get out of my car but she doesnât leave. At this point I donât know what to do so I freak out. We have an argument for an hour. Sheâs not leaving my car and is yelling at me. We eventually decide that I should go to my sisters house to sleep. I leave but now I have so much anxiety that I canât drive. I park my car in a nearby parking lot deciding what I want to do. I have so much anxiety at this point that I made a post of /r/suicidewatch but quickly deleted it. Then my mom calls me and eventually asks me if I am driving to my sisters house. I donât respond to the question because I donât want to lie, and she finds out that Icwas nearby. She freaks out. She accuses me of lying to her when I didnât lie. She then takes her car and starts to find where I was. She finds me and then we have an argument for two hours. She keeps on yelling at me saying that I should come back to the house and âforget about my anxietyâ. I tell her I wanted to go back to the psychiatric ward in the hospital and she says that Iâm being fucking ridiculous and should stop thinking like this. She eventually leaves my car saying that I should come sleep in her house and that âeverything will be fineâ. Right now itâs 2am and Iâm still in my car and Iâm so fucking mentally fucked up I donât know what to do.

"Eating your friend's food Hi I'm curious about something. I always have something to eat in my backpack (chocolate, candies etc.). And I have this friend, who's often hungry and didn't bring any food with her. I have offered my chocolate to her may times . What I can't understand is, that she always takes soooo much. She sometimes even eats all of my chocolate or snacks. It's not that I have problems with it. For me, such a behavior is a lil bit impolite. I'm asking myself, if is it normal to eat all of your friends snack or take so much of it without asking if you can do it? I'm not being racist here. But does it have correlation with a culture?

"Mom treats me like a stray cat and siblings like gold My younger brother and sister are 10/11 years younger than I am. We have an older brother but he no longer speaks to our mother and has t for about 5 years. Iâm an adult now and I fully support myself and have since I was 18. As soon as I graduated high school and child support stopped, I was tossed out of my moms with nothing but garbage bags filled with my clothes. I was told I had to live with father even tho my mother had just bought a house with her husband and my youngest siblings. My stepfather never like me and always kept me separate from their family. They would go to dinner every Friday night and I had to stay home bc he would flip out and many other mean things. To my step dad, I was a stray cat who didnât belong near his children. My mother never stuck up for me and stayed with him until I was in my mid 20s when he cheated on her and left her. I was raised dysfunctional but bc of that I long for a close, supportive family. Once he was out of the picture, I was able to create relationships with my sister and brother. My siblings are now in their late teens and Iâm 26. Iâve struggled immensely on my own I had no choice. I could have 3 dollars to my name and my mother wiuld take it from me for coffee etc. if she picked anything up for me I had to give her the money ASAP. Soon as child support stopped, legit the day I graduated i had to live with my dad and mother gave me only garbage bags with clothes. good. Anything that had been mine was now my sisters (bedroom set, jewelry stand, American girl dolls list goes on. Now years later, my mother makes sure my brother and sister have everything and anything the very best of. Designer everything, newest clothes shoes, technology. When it comes to me, my mother doesnât do anything at all. If she buys the coffee I am to give her to $2 but reversed she would die if I asked for the money back for he coffee. Now foremost, Iâm fully aware I am an adult and can support myself. It has nothing to do with what my mother does for siblings itâs how she treats me compared to her treatment of siblings. For instance, I asked to use sisters perfumes that smelled good and was told no itâs her expensive kind. Iâm not to use anything of my brother or sisters actually. My brother s d sister themselves do not care about this stuff itâs just my mom. When cleaning my face, my younger brother is allowed to use my sisters face cream or anything really bc well they are siblings. But i am not allowed to use the very same thing. If my mother is getting rid of things she will charge me full price. If she orders pizza and I eat a couple pieces I have to pay her half the money. Point Iâm getting at is that she treats me like im not good enough to use my sister expensive designer perfume or face wash etc. she can buy the best of the best for them but charges me if I need anything. Holidays she spends thousands on them and if she does anything for me she only gives me gift she receives for free for spending so much as PINK etc .im not expecting to be equal. Again Iâm an adult and can buy myself things but she canât spend even $25 on a gas card or something lol I should add that it is expected of me to get her and siblings expensive gifts for their bdays and Xmas. Moms bday is in January if I happen to be broke and can only afford a $25 dunkin card, my bday in February she will get me something small or a $5 dunkin card. If I canât afford a gift, she makes damn sure my bday co es and goes without her buying bday gift. Immature or not Iâm very hurt by this. I was always a good kid, never in trouble, finished high school, went to some college and never asked for hand outs. Why am I not worth two small sprays of designer perfume??

"Am I Depressed or is it something else? This seems like a dumb question because to an extent I know I'm depressed but not to a clinical level. Like I hate the situation I'm in. I hate being in debt. I hate living where I live. That sort of thing. However, I'm not unmotivated. Like at all. I'm not hopeless. I'm not suicidal in any way. I'm terrified of death in fact one of my biggest fears is that I'll get so depressed that I'll become suicidal which is weird, I know but the point is, nothing in me wants to die. That being said, I'm tired all the time. I mean physically exhausted. Which seems to contradict major depression. I get up every day, shower every day, though I don't really want to go to work I go to work and do work with no issue (it's more that I don't enjoy my job that much on most days honestly some days it's super fun it's just one of those things it really has to do with the fact that I'm older and I'm not doing what I thought I'd be doing by this point in my life more than I hate my job). I can't think of many reasons why I'd be this physically exhausted all the time. Literally every doctor says ""You you are just massively depressed"". No, I don't believe I'm depressed to the degree that it makes me physically exhausted. If I still have plenty of hope for the future, want to get up, want to get dressed, want to shower, want to look good...how is this major depression to a point where I'm also tired all the time? Is it possible to have some major depressive disorder and not be hopeless and still be motivated to work hard and try new things? Because if it is, someone needs to tell me that. Any time a doctor tells me I must be depressed if I'm so tired all the time and I tell them that I'm not hopeless or suicidal or unmotivated then they go, ""Oh well I don't know what it is then"". I'm very annoyed with this because I never used to be physically exhausted like this before and doctors seem to just dismiss it as depression when I'm positive my depression isn't so bad it's ONLY making my physically exhausted and not having any other emotional affect on me. I'm frustrated so, if anyone can answer this it'd be helpful so I can see what avenue to pursue next. Note: It's not a problem with my thyroid or adrenal gland I already had those checked twice by two different doctors.

"Found out my mother has issues. What should I do? I know it was wrong but I had a gut feeling to check her messages today when I was helping her with something on her phone. I snooped and saw that my mother has been messaging this man (I do know of him as he helped my family in a business transaction 1 year ago). She has been messaging him for a few months almost every other night. It dates back to a year ago but it only started looking obsessive (every other day) from approximately 5 months ago. He has not been replying her. If it's a reply, its extremely rare. It's constant double blue ticks (means he read the message) on whatsapp. What should I do? I'm not sure if my mum realises that this is a creepy act or that she's bothering him because he hasn't said a single word or that she's doing it cause she's lonely and confused.

"My story, i have to get this off my chest. Life sucks Hello everyone, This is a post about my life basically, i just need to get this off my chest. Its a long post but i just have to do this. Let me introduce myself first. Currently im a 19yo boy who turns 20 in March, I live in Belgium (grammar will be bad sorry). I have 1 older brother, 2 loving parents who are still together. And oh yeahh i have a very cute pupper as well. Financially everything is fine. Basically a family some people only can dream for. I mainly play on nintendo consoles (switch, 3ds, gba, n64) and the MMORPG runescape (dont laugh :)) I consider myself a extravert to my friends but an introvert when im talking to girls (lol) or strangers. I've always had a rough time fitting at school. Our elementary school was VERY SMALL, it only had 75 kids (including kindergarden). I was always the ""odd one out"", but because it was so small i had 1 friend. We played alot together and it was a ok time really. but when i was 5 most people around me started to notice that i made weird random noises. And that i made small movements with my shoulders (unnatural ones). Friends got annoyed, parents got annoyed, everyone got annoyed. Eventually my teacher screamed at me telling me to shut up, RIP ME. Eventually mom took me to a specialist and it turned out i have Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, if you youtube this you will get extreme cases where people shout fuck and ass, and move uncontrollably all over the place. THIS IS NOT THE CASE WITH ME. I think Tourette affected my life ALOT (it still does!!). I was always a really shy kid until i was 11, i started to accept my tourettes and was a happy 11yo. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **HIGH SCHOOL** (from 12 to 18yo, its devided in 6 ""classes"". This is where the problems started, when i just started high school i was scared but excited like everyone. Unfortunately for me i got the SHITTIEST bullies in my class. I had no friends in year 1, they made fun of me becuz of my tourettes (i didnt tell them becuz they wouldnt understand). It got to a point where i just smacked someone on the head with a baseball bat. Teachers knew of my situation so we both got 1 week detention. I was ""depressed"" during that year, you know the teenage life, its hard. Year 2 they changed me to another class and they were OK. They didnt bully me but they didnt talk to me either. They just left me alone really, during those 2 years i had 1 friend who i talked with but he also had his own friends. So most of the time i was alone. But that friend had no common interests, so i ended up playing runescape all day, u can talk with other players there and i had plenty of friends in there. It felt awesome to have friends and i spent all my time there neglecting my studies. But somehow i passed the first 2 years lol. I thought year 1 was bad, but then i met year 3 (different school). I got bullied even more in this class, they called me names, ignored me, humiliated me in class and started bitching if they had to sit next to me. Luckily they never got fysical with me (idk if thats the right word). In the middle of that year I decided in the middle of the fucking winter (it was snowing) in morning to take the bus (mom was always home and it was near our house) and to step of early. Spent 2 hours in a small freezing cold chapel playing on my nintendo 3ds, go to my house after mom left and spend playing games in my room. After 3 days the school called, my mom found out. I was stuck and told her everything about the bullying, about me feeling like absolute shit and that i had no motivation to go to school. She let the teachers know, went to school, got me to a psychiatrist. The bullying stopped, but they still ignored me, i still hadnt any friends and i still didnt feel any better. I somehow survived the 4 next months and passed. If i had 1.1% lower in total i would have failed that year. The only way i felt better was with playing runescape. YEAR 4-6 IS IN THE SAME CLASS WITH THE SAME PEOPLE, in year 5 three people joined Year 4 kinda went the same as year 2 believe it or not. The classmates were ok, they didnt bully me, they talked to me when needed but that was it. I spent my time with some kids i met on the playground. But u know they were those kind of friends u just spent time with becuz nobody else is around. They never invited me to go to parties or to hang around or anything. This year was also the 1st year i told them about my Tourette Syndrome ( i got some damn weird looks at times and i didnt even realize i was making sounds). They understood, they acted more nice to me, i didnt feel left out so much but was still unhappy. And on runescape i got into a community (clan), made some good friends there. It was the only place in the word i was truly happy. Year 5, same class as last year. 3 people joined and 1 of them became a friend of mine. To be completely honest he is still one of my best friends today, but i come back to that later. Lets call him J, Ok so now i had a friend. We had a small group of 3 people now, S (other classmate who was

"Iâve come undone Iâm constantly tired, lack care for anything and suicidal thoughts rush through my head almost everyday. My depression is negatively impacting my relationship. She understands what Iâm going through and tryâs to be supportive, but I constantly make actions that push her away. I enjoy hanging out in groups so I can just fade away without anyone really noticing to much (compared to one on one). I really canât live like this. Things are far from the worst theyâve been but i can feel things sinking and sinking. When I feel things going up it just ends up sinking further.

"My dad died today So Iâm 16, coming on 17 next month. Today my dad died at 42. He hasnât been doing so well for a few days. Yesterday his legs gave out and he was stuck on the bed with his lungs in pain if he lay on his back. For 24 hours, no sleep, food, or drink. Many more problems that I cannot remember, and heâs been feeling like shit emotionally too due to family issues. My mom went to check in on him before going to the store. Since yesterday sheâs been trying to get him to go to the hospital but of course heâs stubborn. When she came back from the store, she decided sheâd have the ambulance come and pick him up because he REALLY needed to go in. Slurring his words, despite actually being sober in the mornings. When she went back to get his consent over phone to get picked up for the ambulance, he was out cold already. Lips purple, cold, lifeless. It had been only 30-40 minutes since she last saw him, alive, or whatever was left of his life. I was there to see a fresh dead corpse. My dad. My *dad.* To say my world is crashing around me is an understatement. Iâm just a fucking kid, going through my own battles with myself and now my dad is just *gone.* I didnât have the best relationship with him but he was a really, really good guy and this stings like a bitch. All of it feels unreal and at the same time scarily real. Everything is numb. Iâm lost.

"Debunking âstigmaâ Everybody who questions psychiatry often gets the response âyouâre stigmatising people with mental health issuesâ Whatâs more stigmatising?

Psychiatrists/psychotherapist within the biopsycho model of human emotions, only drug, or involuntarily âhopstialiseâ people Telling people they canât overcome their problems with life due to their bad brain which doesnât operate correctly and the only thing they can do is take a psychiatric drug? Subjecting people to isolation and distancing themselves from people as âdifferentâ due to âmental illnessâ and subjugating the ânormâ from the âmentally illâ subjecting people to drug trials they have ended up in suicide and mass homocide, all for the progress of âpsychiatric medicineâ Telling people that they have biological genetic brain diseases like âschizophreniaâ and theyâll never really live a normal life.

"Writing out my feelings in hopes of gaining some sense of catharsis I'd like to start by saying I don't think I'm a danger to myself. I'm tethered here pretty strongly by my family and my best friend. I can't see myself leaving them, because I've seen what it does to people when those closest to them go. I resent the fact that I can't go, at times, but there's nothing to be done about it really. Most of the people in my life only ever knew my outer shell. The somewhat false personality that I put on in order to function. Over the last three years my mask has been crumbling away and the results haven't been pretty. It's been a viscous feedback loop that leaves me feeling worse and worse as people fall out of my life one by one, either by their own choosing or because I distance myself to hide my pain as I become less and less able to handle it. The summer after my sophomore year I was in the darkest place of my life. I had to pull out of university and move home to get therapy. It was actually very effective, and my junior year was a home run. I was getting the highest test scores in STEM classes with 600 students, I was killing it in my philanthropic efforts, and I had more friends and social obligations than I knew what to do with. My senior year I spent the fall studying abroad in France. It was magical. I fell in love for the first time. I wasn't reciprocated, but the thing I learned about love is that it doesn't have to be reciprocated to be the most beautiful thing you've ever felt. When I got back from France, the seeds of my current ruin were planted. All throughout college I'd been heavily involved with a camp for kids whose parents have cancer. I did it because my dad had cancer when I was a little kid, and the people I met were all wonderful, but most of all because the only thing that gives me a sense of purpose is helping other people. It drives almost everything I do. This camp gave me a rock that I could cling to through the worst of my emotional storms. The two directors of the camp were both new my senior year. While I was in France, one of them dropped out of school due to her own struggles with mental health. The director that was left over was completely overwhelmed, and entirely ineffectual. People left and right were telling me that I should take the open position. I didn't want it; I have ADHD as well as depression and I was so anxious about my lack of organization. Camp was in such a hole though, and for the sake of my friends and my campers and their families I did the only thing I felt like I could do, and took on the directorship. It was rough. My co-director continued to do little of anything, and I felt like I was juggling grenades. I couldn't fuck this up. Kids I'd been mentoring for years needed this camp to cope in a healthy way, and for a number of parent couples, the week of camp was the last time they got to spend alone together before one of them would pass away from cancer. My grades dropped a whole point, on average. My volunteer research suffered, and I really let down the post doc I was assisting (Sorry Bethany). My mental health took a nosedive as well. I made camp happen. It was ugly and bumpy and unorganized, but I made it happen. I took solace in the fact that the kids didn't seem to notice the flaws, but it didn't do a lot good for my relationships with the other volunteers. I redoubled my efforts at the beginning of my 5th and final year of college. I moved into a house with some of the other volunteers who I was closest to. I had to quit my research, and I couldn't keep my grades where I wanted them, but camp planning was progressing well, especially after our national organization took notice of the lack of effort on my co-director's part and added a third director, my friend and newly minted roommate A. A helped enormously, but I still had so much on my plate. To cope with the stress, my drug use started to skyrocket. I was smoking weed and cigarettes all the time, and to keep up with all my biochemistry coursework and 8-10 planning meetings a week I was taking my prescribed adderall more often than I should have been. I became thoroughly addicted. In my final quarter of school, everything really fell apart. I was completely overwhelmed, and became less and less effective at my job. I put A in the exact position that I had been in the previous year. I could feel him resent me more and more every day, but I was too ashamed to talk to him about it, and he never asked me how I was doing. I barely graduated. As soon as school was over I quit adderall cold turkey, because it had been putting me in a very dangerous mental headspace for weeks, but until then it had remained a necessity. The withdrawals hit me like a truck. Getting out of bed felt like a truly herculean task. I was an empty husk of a human being and from graduation to camp in August I contributed almost nothing to the camp. I had nothing left to give. A hated me by that point. He began to tell people what he thought of me, and they listened. I watched helplessly as some of my closest friends and roommates began to look down upon me, if not for what A was saying then for my severely depressed behavior. I

"My depression is getting worse And the bad thing is that I already did all the things that someone would say to a depressed person. I've talked to a lot of psychologists (for about 5 years or maybe more), psychiatrist, I've been on antidepressants meds, I Meditate every day,I have been on several nofap periods (I broke a lot of streaks btw), I do physical exercise (I used to be a gym rat) and when I'm out I try to be social (I'm out basically only when I go to work or to the gym). But still my life is shit, I don't have friends, neither a gf, social interactions with women are nearly 0 and I think that all of them are bitches. I'm also poor and I don't see any way things can get better, I feel like I tried all the things that should help and nothing has helped .

"How to get over my ex best friend Ok so all throughout high school (I graduated high school 4 years ago) I had a best friend. We were sisters literally thought we would be friends forever. We graduated I got into my first relationship and we drifted apart and she never really let me know how she felt. She told me one day she wishes I would stop talking about him so much and that kind of was like ok cool that kind of sucks but not a big deal. Being in my first relationship that Iâm currently still in it sucked not being able to talk about it because I was so excited. Anyways months passed and we got into an argument and basically we ended our friendship because she thought I was an awful friend because I was too busy for her. Fast forward a year after that we started talking again (I reached out, I always do) we started being âfriendsâ again but it felt so awkward. Honestly though sheâs the only one who was ever angry and made things not feel the same. On her 21st birthday she invited everyone to her party at her house but me and told me it was because we didnât talk much and she didnât want awkward vibes at her house. After that I just unfollowed her on social media and we didnât talk at all. I messaged her over the summer congratulating her to see she was taking a trip to China and then she messaged me on my birthday. This all happened in 2017 so our friendship has been fucked up for like 2 years now. Because I deleted her number a while ago I decided to reach out and talk to her on Instagram saying happy birthday and hope she was doing well and she never replied and I know she saw it. So our friendship is dead. Iâve known itâs been dead too for like 2 years now but how do I stop being so damn hurt? I think it hurts even more because she truly doesnât give a fuck and she was my best friend ever. I wish I could go back and do something else to fix it. Idk lately Iâve cried so much. I havenât been able to find a good friend like her again even though she wasnât THAT great. How can I stop obsessing over our friendship and just let it go? I constantly look at her Instagram to see how sheâs doing and it just really sucks. :(

"Best friend drifting away? I've debated whether to post this or not for ages. My best friend is like my sister and has been there for me through really hard times, and I've been there for her. We're similar in so many ways, run a small blog together and I love her to bits. On new years eve she was set up with a guy and they've been dating ever since. Since their first date, we hardly talk. She doesn't even want to talk about him much, and when she does she talks about quitting her job for him, and that he wants to spend the rest of his life with her. They go out drinking a lot, almost every night, it seems like he spoils her and she's told me she's really happy. But at the same time her anxiety is still bad. She's lost her ambition to travel, adventure and take up new hobbies. She doesn't contribute to the blog anymore but says she still wants to carry it on (our domain doesn't expire until July). I feel like I've lost my best friend, but I'm mostly scared that she's already lost herself because of a guy and I just don't know what to do. I've stopped chasing her for plans because she's always busy now (we used to meet up weekly), and stopped messaging because there won't be a reply. She checks up on me every now and then and I haven't been doing well at all, but I don't want the few times we talk to be negative and depressing. I just feel so clueless right now and I miss her. Any advice?

My social skills are out the window, I'm always awkward. I used to write short stories, and I haven't done that in several years. My drawing skills haven't advanced since I was a teen, which is is sad because if I had continued drawing, I would of been a lot better than I am now I bet. :/ I'm trying to slowly build up my artistic love by using adult coloring books, and doodling models. I've become so engulfed with my appearance (I have BDD and anxiety and depression) that I completely abandoned all other parts of my personality that made me special and interesting.

"Doing things that I like reminds me why I don't enjoy doing them anymore. Playing your favorite game? You shouldn't. Remember the time you shut yourself in just to play it endlessly? When nothing else mattered but your game? Finished reading a cool book? Are you going to pick up another one and get sucked in again? Don't forget your friends. Why would you hang out with your friends when they are tired of your negative attitude? Faking a positive attitude is worse. If you're going to be yourself just stay home. Oh you got selected for a great job opportunity? Wait until they realize you're garbage at your job. You have time to relax now? Think again. There's always someone needing something or things that need to be done. Trying to treat yourself? Wait until you see the consequences from buying too many things or eating too much or wasting time. You're actually being responsible and starting work early? Wait until you feel like nothing is worth it anymore. Why does it matter to do things you like if you're just going to feel bad anyways? I've been conditioned to believe these things since I started college and I feel stuck. I'm trying to deny that I believe in these things, but the thoughts keep coming back. I know that I should take care of myself, but I'm so tired of living that I'm hesitant to do anything for myself.

"I have no idea what to do My husband and I got into an argument last night that has lasted until this morning. Through out the entire argument, he has called me horrible names and hurt me deep. I thought i was almost over my depression, I thought i was getting better, but the things he has said has taken me from where I thought I was all the way back down to extremely emotional and having suicidal thoughts. The argument started because I was talking too loudly to his son while trying to correct his behaviour. I am 38 weeks pregnant, and lately have been easily annoyed and upset by the boy not listening to me. My husband called me a bunch of hurtful things because I tried to explain why I was so upset. Later on in the night he told me my mom and oldest sister were no longer allowed to visit me for the birth of our child. Then he spent several more hours talking about how they were ""rot gut whores"" and how he doesn't want them around HIS son all because 2 years ago my sister invited me to a christmas dinner she knew I wasnt going to show up for and didn't specifically include my husband in the invitation. Yet his mom is coming a few weeks after, and she had left him and his brother to fend for themselves in a trailer in the middle of a forest only showing up to bring them food when they called her and begged her for it. But because she ""hasn't done anything to offend"" me, he is totally ok with her showing up. Now he's talking about how if I want my mom to be here so bad, I can leave with her when she visits. And I've fully expressed how depressed I am to him and he isn't even worried in the slightest. He just keeps refering to my past as a teen who would sleep with practically anyone to try to get some sort of pleasure out of life, saying he bets I want to go back to that, that i would treat his son better if he were black, and that i would try harder to not upset my husband if he were black. Part of me hopes something goes REALLY wrong in the birthing process and that I will die or be put in a coma from it. I've never felt so useless, stranded, and alone in my entire life.

"I was rejected &amp; I feel great Last night I asked a close friend of mine on a date and was rejected, but strangely enough I don't feel dejected but rather proud and accomplished. To provide some background, I'll be turning 20 on the 15th, and last year, just 4 days after my 19th birthday, I was diagnosed with Persistent Depressive Disorder. This disorder is characterized by long lasting, essentially uninterrupted periods of depression lasting AT LEAST 2 years, and in many cases, such as with myself, far longer. To provide a rough estimate, I have been depressed somewhere around a total of 13 years of my life. The depression has had a serious negative affect on my love life, at times making me cold and even cruel. The most egregious example of this was when, after having dated this girl for a few months, I stopped talking to her almost entirely and started flirting with other girls. Eventually she had to get her friend to break up with me on her behalf because I was refusing to talk to her. At the time, because of the depression, I thought little of myself, seeing myself as a worthless scumbag, and so I started acting like one. I was also afraid to open up to some else, so instead I became emotionally cold and avoidant. I hated this behavior in myself, and held a deep guilt for how I had treated women I had been with, so about 5 years ago I stopped dating entirely. Despite being rejected, having finally had the confidence and self respect to ask out a woman and accept the no graciously is a major growth in my self esteem and wellbeing, so having done so I feel a great sense of accomplishment. This has really helped boost my self esteem and confidence, even though I was rejected. There's no real point to this story, but I just wanted to get this out there, because I'm really proud of the progress I've made so far.

"relationship with sister falling apart, different memories, need advice Hi, In a nutshell - my sister (both about 30years old) has been accusing me of saying various horrible/bad things, often saying I said it seconds ago, sometimes hours ago and getting angry with me. I don't think I've been saying these things. It's really wearing me down, either I am being horrible and forgetting, or she is (perhaps unknowingly) making it up. I've recently said I'm going to record some of our conversations to see if I can prove my innocence, or find out I have an issue with my memory/attitude and get help. This has gone down very badly, she now insists I don't speak to her for at least as long as I may record her. What do I do? My goal is for my family to get along well, or at least OK - but I have no idea what I can do to fix things or make them better.

"Did your mental health get worse post secondary? So Iâm in grade 12 right now and Iâll probably be moving out and onto a uni campus (if they accept me hopefully) and Iâm honestly pretty nervous. Iâve been clean for a little over a year now and Iâm terrified Iâll relapse and without my parents and dog with me itâll be even tougher. So yeah how do you guys cope with a whole new environment and being away from home? (Also any advice on uni in general would be helpful)

"I am socially awkward and I find it so hard to get close to people? I have very few friends. Basically one good friend and a bunch of people that i started to become friends with but i haven't been able to get close to. I have no idea how to become close to people and make friends and I am getting more and more depressed by the day. It feels like no one likes me, and I have absolutely no idea if thats the depression talking or if thats the truth and I am depressed because i finally realized that. I am so confused and I don't know what to change and what is stopping me from becoming better friends with people. I don't know if I am an unlikable person or if I am just really awkward and that is what repels people. I don't know what kind of an answer I am looking for, but I just need something to give me hope, like for something i can change or do to give me confidence to talk to people. Thanks for any answers, anything helps.

"hey there depression, itâs me, ya boi (a letter for u by urs truly) dear depression, look, my dude... i havenât showered in a week, and although i bleached my hair so you canât see how dirty it is when that happens, i can still feel it and would really like to use that coconut shampoo i bought that makes me smell like, well, coconuts. iâm not sure what i smell like right now, but itâs probably not fruit. maybe that lavender febreze i spray all the time, if iâm lucky. i havenât done laundry in a month or so. i wore the same two dirty pairs of pants to work all week - the long ones, because even though itâs been around 95F all week, i havenât worked up the energy to shave my legs in forever. like sure itâs 2018 and girls can be as hairy as they want these days woo go feminism or w/e but jeannie from accounting noticed when i had two vaguely different socks bc i was too lazy to find a matching pair and i donât need to give her any more reasons to open her big mouth tbh. i only got out of bed today to pee and eat a sandwich (which i thoroughly enjoyed - the sandwich, not the pee... but maybe the pee a little bit too... not in a weird way tho - so itâs nice to know i can still enjoy things, even if iâve developed an unhealthy coping method with food and am going to get fatter and hate my body even more. but hey, at least itâs not drugs). which also reminds me that i need to do dishes... or i could just keep buying disposable dishes, so that i can let that pile up in the trash i desperately need to take out instead. i have shit iâve got to do that i was supposed to do last weekend, but also spent that weekend in bed (youâre terrible in bed btw), and considering that iâm writing this at 6am instead of sleeping like i was supposed to start doing several hours ago - after i was supposed to take the meds that i didnât get up to take - the forecast for today is pretty bleak as well. of course, you know all this, because you like to stop by every couple weeks and make sure of it. i think youâre more regular than my time of the month (which would probably be more regular if i could just stick to taking my birth control every day, but we already established that i suck at taking pills that iâm supposed to). i wish i could just get up and do what i need to do like a real adult - so many people do it, and on my best days i can even pretend to be a real adult as well. but with you here, lurking around my apartment without even helping with the vaguely overpriced rent, i canât seem to get anything done. so if you could just, like, leave for a couple of days before i run out of clean underwear too, i would greatly appreciate it. sincerely, a concerned citizen

"I checked myself in to a Mental Hospital I decided after dealing with months of annoying suicidal ideation that I should go to a mental hospital. I say annoying because I was aware of these increased thoughts and wanted nothing to do with killing myself. While I wanted a closed environment away from home stressors to solve my issues I was also afraid of going somewhere unknown. I went through with it (despite crying and feeling emotional on the way there) to get my life turned around. I feel very often that horror stories are told of hospitals. In reality, if you need the help, please seek it out. You may have a completely different experience than someone who claims they don't remember their stay and was drugged up to their eyeballs. My experience was a pleasant one overall. I went there and focused on fixing my issues and I'd say I came out feeling better. I'm not sure if I can or should give the name of the place but I'm sure someone can let me know down below. I just want to share my experience and help people not feel so afraid of going to one. The place was pretty clean. An adult area for people 18 and over, rooms and halls split by gender. Bathrooms only seemed a bit off towards the end of the day or during the morning when people would shower. Roommates were sweet and tidy thankfully but the option to change roommates if there was a problem was always available to me. Groups were informative and engaging as well as encouraging for others to speak up if they wished. You had a good amount of personal time to do whatever. Outdoor activities were available permitting the weather. The place was meant for short stays of up to a week so anyone who's still there for longer may see the groups as too repetitive. The food was surprisingly delicious and great. Honestly expected school lunch type of food but there was variety and options for those allergic, vegetarian or needing gluten free food. There were staff members around whenever you needed them for anything. The treatment team could've been better. They were good to me but not to everyone there. Changed meds without informing me. I went from 5 to 10 to 15mg of Abilify. Good Lord I felt it once I was home. Then REALLY felt it when they made a mistake and I went cold turkey for two weeks because I couldn't get my prescription filled. I'll update once I'm properly back on it. So that's my experience. After a week, I came out feeling better. I got off of Wellbutrin after determining it could be the cause of my increased depression. The Abilify gives me energy to get up and not be stuck in bed all day. I feel better than when I went in. I know this is a long post, however I've been afraid of sharing my experience with others. I don't want to feel afraid of ashamed of having went, so here I am with this post. If this is also posted in the wrong place, please let me know and I'll gladly move it to the right subreddit.

"Today just sucks I've been sitting at my desk at work for the past hour and a half crying on and off. Not really sure why. I feel physically sick and I just want to go home, crawl into bed, and sleep for a few days. I'm supposed to teach a class tonight, but I'm really not sure I can function around people. I know I should just cancel it, but I feel guilty doing that, and I have no idea why. It makes no sense since I can't seem to bring myself to care about anything else right now- like the fact that I've gotten almost nothing done at work today and probably won't in the remaining 3 hours.

"feeling betrayed My best friend and I are dating two guys who are also best friends and roommates. At first we all got along great and had a lot of fun. Out of nowhere my best friends boyfriend started voicing how he really felt about me. He told her and my boyfriend (his best friend) that he hates me and canât stand to be around me. He even said âseeing her is the worst part of my day.â This is only one of many many rude and uncalled for things he has said about me. He acts as though I am a nuisance when I have never done anything to him. My boyfriend and I canât even be around them anymore because of how bad itâs gotten. It hurts that my friend allows this to happen and wants to be with someone who acts like this. Itâs weighing heavily on me.

"The Last of Us I just finished my second playthrough, PS3 (im poor, sue me bitch). after the part with the cannibals, ellie sat on a bench and didn't talk much. this, in combination with when she says ""he tried to..."" to joel after she kills david, made me get a bit angry and sad. then i thought about my female friends (few as they may be) and family and how if any ever hurt them in such a way, especially my family, well i think it's better if that's left unsaid. had to pause the game for a min to cry. i never thought i'd be so depressed that a video game could make me cry (and i've played a lot of games, over 1,200 trophies on PSN. only this one made me cry). and in retrospect, i now think i've come to appreciate at least one aspect of my depression: emotion and the appreciation of it. sometimes i can look at someone, there body language, listen to them and feel there pain, suffering and sadness. i now appreciate The Last of Us, life and other people more. although i did feel more alone afterwards (especially since i think it'd be wonderful to find a girl that has a personality like ellie's. never had a gf, had any physical romantic interaction with a girl or even been on a date. i was 12 when the game was released and will probably still be 16 when part 2 comes out, so we ain't dealin with no pedo shit in these christian suburbs) it was definitely worth it. -just thought i'd share that in the hopes that it would brighten someone's day.

A year has passed and everything is the same, I'm living the same day over and over again and I don't know how much longer it will last. Why am I always in my own head?

"Me and my brother cannot stop fighting This is DAILY. I'm 18 and in college, he's 15 and in high school. My mom works like 6 days a week and is barely home except for in the morning (when he's already at school) and at night (comes home anywhere from 9-11pm). He's nothing but a spoiled brat who gets everything his way, and we have to share a room in our condo which seriously sucks. I get 0 privacy and I'll be trying to do homework and he'll blast his stupid gaming YouTube videos and refuses to turn it down. I'll go downstairs to do it and he'll end up coming down 20 minutes later, and it's an ongoing cycle. He gets really mad and throws a lot of fits and I seriously think he's a psychotic freak. He was yelling at me and throwing a childish tantrum a few months ago and one of the neighbors called the police, but they never came to our door. Since then, he still hasn't learned his lesson and STILL continues to throw these huge fits when he doesn't get his way. We've had a rough past, and he doesn't realize that since my mom is always working that I'm basically the one that's in charge around here. I'm not bossy, either, I am completely fair. But since I've always been the one to do everything, he's used to sitting on his overweight ass all day playing video games. Now that I'm a full time college student, I don't have time to do things around the house that I could before. He refuses to do anything including even fixing his bed. I tell my mom ALL the time to do something but even if she does, he'd throw a fit. I seriously think he just needs to be put on medication because his behavior is very VERY out of control. We've been arguing and fighting so bad daily for the past year or two and it's just getting progressively worse. I don't know what to do. I seriously would move out right now but that's not an option as I don't have time to work a full time job and take 17 credits while paying for schooling AND rent/utilities/gas/etc. It's just becoming such a toxic place to come home to that I just stay at the library or starbucks because I dread coming home because I know he'll always start something, but even when I do come home it's always yelling and fighting even if I bite my tongue and stay silent. He DOES NOT LISTEN!!! He thinks HE'S in control. If he were my child, I would've taken every possession he has (iPhone, Xbox, etc) and made him sit in his room all day being forced to read a book and learn to respect people older than him! He talks back to my mom A LOT, and the thing that makes me mad is we won't even do anything to him. I know people will be trying to say, ""Well maybe don't try to boss him around"" but the thing is I DON'T. I'll just be like, ""Make sure you clean your half of the room"" or ""Be sure to take the dog out"" or ""Make sure you unload the dishwasher"". I don't know what to do anymore. I think I'm gonna force him to go sleep in the basement because I haven't even gotten a full nights rest since summer and I feel like I'm starting to get depressed. Every day he's always calling me names, and it gets so bad that I have to call him something back in order for him to even realize what he's saying to me. I'm just so over this and this extra stress is seriously making me feel nauseous trying to balance school along with it. I've tried talking to a few people about this, but all they say is, ""Awe it'll get better"". WELL AT THE RATE IT'S GOING NOW, IT WONT. I just don't know what to do. It would be a lot easier if I had my own room so I could get a quiet space for privacy and alone time away from him.

"My boring sob story Family members told me all the time that being an adult is shit and I should make the most of being a kid. So when depression hit me I thought it was normal, but it didnât feel âright.â I wasnât upset all the time, it was just like a flat misery sort of feeling. Things started to feel odd for me, certain sounds and smells and silly things like the wind of my face felt wrong. Like theyâd be toned down somehow. Eventually I became completely disconnected from my emotions, save for the occasional moment when I actually find something funny. Iâve been on two types of medication and had therapy too, neither of which did anything for me. I didnât notice myself become so gradually withdrawn from everything. Now going to the shop or getting the bus is something Iâd rather not do. Things Iâd do every day. My social life went backwards as well as my social skills. Now Iâm afraid to talk to people. I literally reject girls Iâm interested in on the spot, before I even have chance to fuck it up myself. Things that I would do without thinking now take encouragement and energy. Then came the cynicism. Belief that nobody out there was pure and everything they did was for their own personal gain. Suppose itâs true in a sense but I wish I didnât have this âpaint everybody with the same brushâ mindset. Itâs hard to believe Iâm the same person at times. Itâs been 7 years now and Iâve had enough. Just dunno what to do. I feel like Iâve tried everything. Canât help but feel Iâm partly responsible, for buying into the shit I told myself.

"I don't even know I don't know if I'm depressed or just the good 'ol sad. I can't fully express how I feel because the inside of my head is a mess. I don't want to give what I feel everyday the label of ""depression"", I feel like it just insults the people who knows they have depression. I have no idea where to get any help for whatever I feel. If I did, I would either be too lazy or too shy to ask. I am too lazy. Everything is just too tedious. In everything I do, halfway through it I just feel an intense urge to give up, and I do. I can't find a proper hobby to distract myself from whatever's inside my head. I can't focus. It is so hard to focus on anything. I just stared at the blinking blue bar for 5 minutes just to type this unecessary sentence, because I lost whatever I wanted to write here in the maelstrom of thoughts inside my head. I used to be smart, or atleast feel smart. Lately I feel like I've dumbed down. Questions that I used to answer easily became hard for me. English, something I was proud of for learning it by myself, became harder for me. My memory isn't what it used to be. I'm jealous of other people who can properly comfort their depressed loved ones. Everytime, it pains me that I can't find anything in my head or say anything to make them feel atleast a little better. It eats me inside that I know they're suffering and I can't make them feel that someone cares when they think that no-one does. I am a fake. i'm not sure if any of you will get what I'm saying but, eh. I can't even understand myself.

There's no set schedule, except for one family dinner and one family breakfast. Everyone is in different life stages, so it was best to let everyone venture off on their own. I figured we'd coordinate events and rides with folks once we got there but nothing set in stone.

"Might have gotten my friend fired at work First of all: hello! Iâm just gonna jump right in. So I (23/f) have been best friends with this girl (letâs call her maya) for about 3 1/2 Years now. Another girl (we will go with Ashley) became part of our group about a year later and maya asked us to start working at the restaurant she served at part time. Eventually, maya started a thing with this guy who was in a relationship at the time, so we obviously didnât really put a lot of hope into the whole thing. But eventually he broke up with the other girl to be with maya. Now she started really getting into weed (like 3 blunts a day all by herself) and then dropping pills on the weekends. Ashley and I are not into it so we stayed away but tried to still hang out but it got more and more difficult being with her because she either a) fell asleep b) throw up all the time c) was just super uncomfortable to be around. Also work got fucking disastrous because she asked us to pick her up and every single time she either overslept or just forgot about it... so we were always late with her. Last week it really excalated: she left Ashley hanging for over an hour, didnât pick up her phone, I cancelled all my plans to go to work instead of maya and or coworker was all by himself with a huge group of guests. And all she did was send us a voice mail telling us what we should tell our boss. (Not even a reason why all of it happened) Obviously, we were both really pissed and I just told our superior what had happened and why I was there instead of her. Needless to say he was mad and said that our boss has to talk to her about this because it obviously just a big no go. The issue is, she kind of expected us to lie for her and I donât think I can deal with that anymore. She has become so enstranged lately and I donât want to support her selfish and self-destructive behaviour. But now I guess I might have made her lose her job and i donât know if I should apologise and try to talk our boss into letting her stay or just accept that sheâll hate me forever and go on with my life. Iâve told her that I donât like the whole drug thing but she laughed it off, called me a coward and sheltered. But she also treats me (and Ashley to an extend) like her servants and all my other friends canât stand to be around her. So really, i donât know how to approach her with the whole situation because in the end Iâm going to be the horrible friend that ruined her life. Should I apologise or/and try to damage control the whole thing at work? TLDR: friend has drug problem and left all of us hanging at work again so i didnât play along with the hundredth shitty excuse She wanted us to tell

"In a bad headspace after a breakup with someone who finally made me feel like things would be okay Itâs been a week since I returned from a six month exchange program overseas. There, I ended a 2y relationship with an addict, who I still cared for but could not love anymore. Then, of course, I fell in love with someone. We were inseparable for the six months. As I struggle with depression, anxiety and schizoaffective disorder, it hasnât been the easiest for him. We planned to end our relationship and continue as friends, but just couldnât bear to at the departure gates. We decided to try a long distance relationship, but after a week, heâs had enough of me. He has his own problems, and we live 20 hours apart with a 12h time difference, so I donât blame him at all. I do however carry a lot of resentment for myself for being so down in the past week and pushing him. I used to be really sociable, but a multitude of issues have led me to slowly isolate myself from people. I still have friends, but they either donât actually gaf or they have their own problems and I donât want to add on to their burdens. Itâs also very difficult for me to meet people without any alcohol or drugs to calm the anxietyâsomething Iâm trying to stay away from as my addiction problems have led me to the psych ward. Besides, how much can friends be there for you? Itâs you alone in your bed staring at the ceiling til noon the next day for days on end (Iâve had terrible insomnia since coming home). Iâm still on school break, cannot really occupy my mind by going outside to meet friends or take a part time job or just walk around due to anxiety and psychosis, and all the things I used to watch/do to cheer myself up (music, slam poetry, writing, youtube, netflix, games) I have associated very strongly with him as we have very similar habits. So anything that could make me pass the time makes me sad. Iâve loved and lost many times and I know it gets better eventually, but currently it gets very very dark in my mind and Iâm not sure what I can do to survive in the meantime. Iâm in a very bad place and feel very anhedonic and suicidal thoughts are back (having been accumulated from all these problems). He was the one person that made me feel like someone understood and was there in this big bad world, and without him I feel like Iâm floating and nothing will make me feel okay again for a long time.

"My parents only having expectations for me to succeed just makes me feel like the biggest failure of my brothers. Which not only is bullshit but also makes me just not try in the first place a lot of the time. Because if I try and fail its worse because Iâm expected to succeed. I donât even understand why they expect me to be the successful one. I barely got acceptable grades in high school until senior year when I just took easy courses. I failed English and nearly failed Spanish in 9th grade because I was too lazy to put in any effort. I barely ever brought home friends or did extracurricular activities most of high school. But for some reason Iâm their grand vision for whoâs gonna make the family proud.

"Why is it so difficult to preserve wealth within a family for longer than one hundred years? Some family members can make fortune during their lifetime. Because they were lucky, or because they worked hard, or smart. It doesnât matter. It is almost inevitable that after two generations passing the lucky one the third generation returns to the poverty with very poor financial background. There are always and always will be more failures than successful stories. Why is it happening? Because of mismanagement. There are no other reasons! Not because they are too old, too young, too tall, or too stupidâ¦ But, because they failed to create a system which can monitor, rule, manage, predict future successes and failures. Most families have no idea that such systems have been existing and successfully helping some families to do this job efficiently. Do those families share this knowledge with humanity? No way. Why would they do that? They literally rule the world, they have all the power and all the money. Iâm fortunate to collaborate with some of those families. What if I ask you: Would it be interesting for you to uncover their secrets and to know how they do it? Would it be interesting for you to see a blueprint of their success? Many families are struggling in our society. They have no idea where they are going to and what goals they have. It leads to frustration, procrastination, apathy and depression. Because they have been caught in a daily routine. Day after day, month after monthâ¦ No time to think, no time to plan, no time to review or set goals. In my opinion, this is the reality for 99,99% of the human population of the Earth. Is there a solution? Yes! But, you have to implement some strategies. It includes not only intellectual, emotional and spiritual development, but financial evolution also. Without a strong financial fundament, it is almost impossible to cultivate wealth in your family in a long-term run. To be continued. Rey

"Is it obvious when you have depression? I wonder if I have some form of mild depression or I just have low self esteem. I became a mute quite a few years ago after acouple of events that got me down. I think it may have been catatonia. But I'm not 100%. Ever since then I don't feel like I got back to my normal self. I'm a lot shyer and I don't have much luck socially or romantically or in my career. The best way to put it would be I lost my personality. I can really beat myself up sometimes because I hate myself. When something bad happens I really start self loathing quite badly. I don't feel suicidal. I hate myself more than I hate my life. I blame my lack of success on myself. I don't enjoy things as much as I used to so I have no real hobbies. I don't think I'm likable and I can't even pass interviews these days. I lost my personality and that's why I hate myself. I'm unrecognisable to who I used to be so I isolate myself a lot more these days. I don't think significantly depressed but I wonder if mild depression is the cause of my loss of personality? Or could it be something else that caused me to change? All I know is I've lost a lot of confidence and I'm always beating myself up about it

"My Story of Elder Abuse: Internet Romance Scams and the devastating consequences I'm living a nightmare watching a woman 50 years younger than my 80-year-old father coerce him into marriage, manipulate him and taking his money all in the name of ""love"". The relationship started as Ghanaian romance scam (usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/romance-scams/) and after we uncovered it was a male in Ghana pretending to be an American woman, it eventually led to a Ghanaian woman residing in Cuba, showing up at my father's doorstep and coercing him into marriage two weeks later. The story is long, complex, and out of this world so I won't go into it here. We've tried it all: FBI, USICE/immigration, State Dept., AARP, private investigators, the District Attorney, police, adult protective services, elder abuse attorney's and filing for conservatorship. The harsh reality I'm learning is though the crime is so blatantly obvious to everyone, I'm told over and over by the authorities that individuals have the right to abuse themselves. My father is showing serious signs of dementia but his executive functioning is still intact and we cannot get him to see a neuropsychologist without a long and painful court battle. To the outside world, he comes across as just fine, but my normally mild-mannered, extremely rational and brilliant father has had explosive and violent episodes, personality changes, impulsive behavior, and has been unduly influenced and taken advantage of over an over again. He cannot see that people are lying to him even though the lies are later revealed to him. I've had a huge reality check just how powerful civil liberties to make bad decisions are in the USA along with the financial rights that coexist in marriage, no matter how corrupt. I'm not writing for advice since I know in my heart my father is not well and is no longer the father I know and love. What I want to know is if anyone else out there has experienced elder financial abuse in their family, and romance scams or partner abuse in particular. I want to hear your story. I am appalled that though financial elder abuse is rampant throughout the USA, and internet romance scams are only on the rise, there seems to be no major initiatives or policies to protect our vulnerable elders. Thank you.

I know that i made the right choice but..i didn't think that at 18 i would be making this choice. At 18, i should be getting ready for college and figuring out my major not mourning the death of my child. I feel like such a loser. All my friends and family are getting ready to start this new and exciting chapter in their lives and I'm in my room crying like an idiot because not only did i have an abortion but i also just lost my shitty part time job.

"overbearing family. I (19f) am living away from home for college in my 2nd year. However, I still feel very under the control of my mother. It is just me and her at home, and rest assured she has always done her best for me but recently Iâve had enough of how much she expects from me. I am studying for grade 6 piano and the fact is that I simply donât have time for it. She wanted me to do the exam for it after only studying it for 3 months (bare in mind I only get to practice once a week as I have no piano away from home - I come home at weekends). When I postponed it she screamed at me for hours and called me an idiot and various other things. I told her I was too busy with college work, I got my results back for college and did very well; however, she still wasnât happy. First comment was âmaybe youâre not as stupid as we thinkâ and then said that I could do a lot better, even though I did really well. I never leave the house when Iâm at home for weekends or any holidays because when I go out or meet my friends she makes it very difficult as she usually starts a row before I leave and guilt trips me about going. I have been wanting a full time bar job for summer, as thatâs where my experience is but she is even controlling where I work and telling me where to apply to. She keeps guilt tripping me about being away for college, and saying Iâm on a permanent holiday. She is annoyed at me for having a boyfriend; she never uses his name only refers to him as âyour friendâ in a sneering voice, and she wonât meet him. She is by no means a bad person, she has always been a very good mother but the pressure she is putting on me is too much and I feel very restricted, and at times, controlled. BUT I am not giving out about her, simply want to understand why she is acting this way when Iâve given her no reason to distrust me and Iâm trying my best. TL;DR - mother is controlling, putting huge pressure on me and is never happy no matter how well I do.

"I can't seem to be happy with my current life - only the future So I was diagnosed with mood swings/mild depression quite a while ago, and have been on a small dose of Fluoxetine (Prozac) most of my life now. Based on looking at objective measures, I should be feeling pretty content right now, but I can't seem to be happy about it, and only about the things that I hope I'll work towards in the future. I guess for example - I've lost a little over 30 pounds since February, the first significant time I've actually lost weight, and I'm now no longer medically obese... but I still just feel fat and haven't been able to feel anything good about the weight I've actually lost. I have a great job, and am just about to finish paying off all my loans, but I don't feel any accomplishment in that either. I keep thinking maybe I'll feel good when I have enough to put down a down-payment on a house, but I doubt that will be the case. I have a bunch of great friends, but I'm tired of being single again. I know that I should just focus on the good things right now, but it's not seeming to be any consolation. My faith life has been doing pretty good recently too, especially compared to the past, but I still feel like a shitty person a lot. I dunno, I know that so many other people are having a rough time and I should be happy with how things are going, but I'm just down right now.

"Abnormal I'm so used to being depressed and anxious I'm amazed how people can act normally in general. I'm like how do they do it? I'm so used to feeling uncomfortable in my skin that its normal for me to feel awkward and weird in social situations. The fact that people everywhere don't have to deal with this everyday and just can ""be themselves"" without breaking a nervous sweat blows my mind. I feel abnormal and tired of it. This is the part people don't understand. I've met shy people and they are effective communicators once they get over that initial hesitancy of speaking. When you're overcome with social anxiety, depression, and feelings of incompetency its damn near impossible to speak or want to. Every word you utter to someone is misinterpreted because half the time its not heard or not what you meant to say. So frustrating I can't explain it but its killing me. How I feel and how incapable I am in saying what I feel.

"I finally came out to my close friends that I have depression, and now I'm being alienated because I'm ""not mentally stable"" Probably a rant, but what the fuck. This last college semester was horrible on me, and I came out of it with depression and depression meds. I'm 19M in college right now. I thought it was pretty obvious, but I wanted to tell my friends about why I've been talking less and have been hermitting myself out a little. So the next time we're all together, I tell them that I have depression and that's why I'm taking meds and that's why I've gotten so quiet, ect. And... Barely any response. Basically just some ""oh, ok..."" Like really? But it get's better. So the night after I tell them, I get a message from one of my ""friends"", whom I was going to room with next year. The message said, and I can quote, that they ""don't feel safe around a mentally dark person"" in their house. Ok, what? Even better, the convo goes on and says that my group of friends were talking... And they don't want to, in quotes again, ""Associate with a mentally dark person"" as a friend. Like what the fuck? It's been a week and they've lived up to it. Suddenly I'm not getting invited anywhere or anything. If I'm with my friends (I still try to hang out), I'll get heavily ignored. Like what the fuck, my depression has now gotten so much worse. I want to ditch every single one of them, but I honestly don't have any other close friends outside of this group. I'm trying my best to find new friends, and if that happens, I 'll happily leave these people who consider depression sufferers ""dark and unstable and unsafe"". Just needed to rant Edit: Also thank you for all the hug PMs they really do help ;-; Edit 2: Wow this blew up, in my point of view anyways. I'm going to talk to them, and cut out whoever is still toxic about it. I'm going to try hard to make new friends. **I WILL MAKE A PART 2 TO THIS IN MAYBE A WEEK OR TWO, JUST TO UPDATE WHAT IS HAPPENING BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE GONE/ARE GOING THROUGH THIS AND I WANT TO HELP THEM IF I CAN WITH MY CURRENT STUGGLE** Edit 3: REALLY THANK YOU FOR ALL THE HUG COMMENTS AND PMs ;-;

Everyone says it's supposed to get easier, but it doesn't. I've tried reaching out a couple times to talk to someone about it but they really don't want anything to do with me. I don't blame them though, it's not their fault nor are they obligated in any way to be friends with me. I feel like I'm becoming a bigger burden on those around me. I think I'm just not built for this world. I understand not everyone is, but I'm starting to come to terms with it and I'm getting really close... real close. I don't know how to cope with any of this and I'm just going to stop trying to. If it happens, it happens. No big deal in the grand scheme of things.

People who have been there 3 weeks are telling me how to do things. I sat down with my manager this morning and explained it all.

"Money and power are your friend, not human beings! I am cynical about friendship from my recent experience. I am from a well-off family but Iâd tried to live by my own and lived in a very tiny studio. To my well-off friends, I might look humble. They partied, traveled, and dined together without me, and kept those in secret (some of those events were blurted by mutual friends). Especially one of them frequently ignored me. When I really needed someone in order to be discharged from a hospital, that person didnât help me even though she could - she didnât even hide it. My parents didnât like me living in a small place rent, so they bought me a very nice condo. Those well-off friends learned this news and they were excited about it. The woman whoâd been ignoring me and hadnât helped me out, volunteered to help my moving. I refused. When I had a house warming with them, they saw my place and was anxious to be invited to any of my future parties at this new place (yes, itâs a really nice place.) And then, they started to invite me to their exclusive parties and dining gatherings. They even asked me why I put some distance from them. It was ridiculous. Why did you guys act like youâd been caring about me so much? Life has taught me that my true friends are money and power, not human beings.

We have been seeing each other behind his back for about 3 or more years every other day. She tells me everything about them. How sex with him is awful. Which I knew already because he asked me what he should do about it. I gave him good advice. I guess it didn't change anything. The sex with her is amazing. I think it's how taboo it is. We're all over each other. She lets me do things to her that She won't let my friend do on her , like anal I was the first one to ever do anal and throat fuck her and STILL do it. She wants a relationship with me and there's no way in hell that's going to happen. She thinks that I'm in love with her and that we will be together. She talks about us running far away together. All I have to do is say the word. I'm a big believer in ""once a cheater, always a cheater"". But she seems to be in love with me. My gut is telling me shes in love with me. My gut is never wrong. I guess I'm doing both of them wrong. I know he uses reddit so I'm not going to give all the details. I also want to add that I still respect the guy a whole lot. I would hate to lose his friendship. I know I should stop but the sex is just so addicting. She had sex with my brother too.

He's been ignoring me in person, taking forever to text back, and being really passive aggressive while texting me. It really hurts me that he does this, because he knows I have bad mental health, but he only makes me feel worse about it by making me feel worse about myself.

But I love him to death, when he is around, he supports me. But the moment he stops, he acts like I don't exist. It's tearing me apart. I'm scared to talk to him about it because I don't want him to hate me anymore than I feel like he already does, but I just don't know what to do about it. I feel so alone without him, and I really need some comforting words, and maybe some advice on what to do.

I havent been happy for the last 11 years and when i finally am happy and get into the swing of it, it fucks off and leaves me to suffer. Rant; for the last 10 years my dad has had cancer, hes not well at all. It seems im the only one who gives enough of a shit to help him. I wouldve moved away and had a life by now, but ive stayed purely for him. Last week i realised hes manipulating me to get anything he fucking wants. The girl ive been chasing for 6 months that i fell in love with has just fucked me off. Long story short about 3 months ago she had a 2 year anniversary with a guy but admitted she has a thing for me. So i waited it out and about 3 weeks ago they broke up so i thought 'hey, ill see if i can hang out with her and see what happens' nope. Told her i still feel how i did and she just says 'i see you as a friend and nothing more'. Maybe im just not cut out to be here, or to deal with people?

"Been depressed for so long that i cant remember the last time i was myself. Hey guys this is my first post here and i dont know where else to go. Ive been in a dark place for a long time but im the kind of person who channels this into humor so not even my family could tell. I just turned 20 yesterday and ive been depressed for about 2 years now. I havent opened up to anyone about it because i keep brushing it aside thinking it would pass but it just keeps getting worse. Today i realized something that made me genuinely cry, i seriously didnt remember the last time i was myself. I used to be super carefree and relaxed, i was full of energy and would answer any call to chill in seconds. I just asked my close friend when was the last time he remembers the real me and he said it was the beginning of college and im currently finishing my second year. Its been getting progressively worse in the last 6 months with a serious drop in my appetite. I also started feeling anxiety for the first time in my life and suicidal thoughts are uncommon Ive lost about 10 pounds in 2 months because of this. My grades also took a hard hit, going from a 3.0 gpa every semester to a 1.7. I just had a talk with my mom and she told me that im being ungrateful and that i need to get my shit together (ironic considering she suffered depression for years until i pushed her to divorce my father). Im not blaming her at all for my situation because she was raised by two hardasses so i understand why its hard for her to understand why a teen would be depressed. I know that life is worth it and it gets better but i really cant keep the darkness out of my head. Weed has kept me sane for a while but quitting recently caused it to come back full force and i really need advice on how to get back on track. Thanks in advance to whoever takes the time to read this long ass fiesta.

"Does anyone else feel insanely angry when they see injustice against others? Like I feel like I seethe with rage when I see others being mistreated Every time I watch the news about the political storm in America or anything I see in my twitter about police brutality or slavery in Libya, etc. I seethe with rage. I can't stand seeing so many people being tortured financially, mentally, physically. I hate it. I feel powerless and I feel angry. I feel like my depression grows with other people's pain. The more I see injustice, the more powerless and worthless I feel in the world.

"I feel like I'm not cut out to be an adult in this life. r/GetMotivated hardly helps me so I don't know why I still visit it. I always see some stupid bullshit like, ""When life knocks you down, get up and knock it down harder"" or whatever. I know it works for some people, but that stuff just makes me angry because it's *so* not me. I'm not a fighter. I don't understand how to just keep pushing and keep going on like that. I guess I've been doing that somewhat if I've made it to be 21 but I'm so fucking miserable. I don't understand how people get motivated and ""just deal with it"" and all that shit. And I know it's a meme to say that you're fine but don't want to get into because they wouldn't understand but it's so fucking true, and I know I'm just feeding into the cliches. Going back to the title, I think it's entirely likely I'm not meant to survive on this earth. In a universe that's so fucking vast, it makes too much sense for there to be the possibility that some humans just aren't meant to live like everyone else. Maybe I'm destined to kill myself. I'd rather not, I'd rather something else kill me so I *don't* have to deal with it.

"Mom always trying to ask me uncomfortable questions and gets mad when I express my feelings about them I'm 20 years old and I've been with my boyfriend a little over 2 years. I know I'm young. Will my relationship last forever? There's a good chance it won't because both of us are very young. However, that doesn't mean I don't know how to be in a relationship or know if I love someone or not. My mom has a bad habit of asking really odd, seemingly disrespectful questions to me and my brother about our relationships. A popular one she gives me is ""I don't think you love him, he's more like you friend."" She asked me this tonight over a phone call and I got upset with her and expressed how I feel uncomfortable and disrespected when she tells me things like that. Like she know's everything about my relationship, somehow, when I hardly tell her anything about it because her and my dad are quite old fashioned and very religious. She's told me things like this many times before, and usually I try to just try to brush it off, but I'm trying to get her to understand and communicate better with me and my brother. She went on to say say ""but i'm your mom, I can ask things like that."" I understand she has a much different point of view, especially because she's older, but I just personally feel it's disrespectful to say that I don't love my boyfriend and that ""he's just a friend."" She kind of rolled her eyes at me, flatly said goodnight, and hung up. Am I overreacting? i feel like I shouldn't be guilty for expressing my feelings of being uncomfortable with the questions she asks me. My parents have both lacked communication skills my whole life, and it's put us in a rocky relationship. I love my mom, but I'm just trying to get her to understand modern day relationships and me as pretty much a grown adult. Thoughts?

"going through life waiting for it all to end soon i got nothing going for me in my life. im 22 and never had a girlfriend. you know what, i never even had a friend..guy or girl. im tired of going to college and doing meaningless work and for what? so i can join the rat race? i dont want to grow old, it's only going to get worse as i age, especially healthwise. im totally awkward, can't make conversation beause there's nothing interesting about me,and im really ugly..so that means no one would even bother taking an interest in me and approach me to really talk. like that would be one of the major reasons why i never even had a friend, not to mention a girlfriend! and im poor, so i dress stupid. it's the same thing every single day, i go to school, don't talk to anyone, and go home. i dont even have a job, and i dont drive. i just hope i go away soon, like get a terminal illness, that would make everything so much easier. i don't know, i'm just rambling here. i can't really describe everything in words here, you would have to be in my shoes to really get it, so to speak.

"My family might break apart... Sorry this is a long post. Yes I know this is common thing sadly. But I donât want it to, 12 years my family have been together. Just to start off, There is me, my brother, my dad and mum. So my dad has anger issues. His parents never told him it was wrong so he has been like this all his life. Our mum is his second wife because his first wife divorced him for all the reasons Iâm about to mention. We only listen to him because he rules out of fear, he isnât teaching us anything, and is a bad influence on us. When he gets annoyed he yells really loudly on purpose for everyone to hear (including our neighbours) then drives off for an hour. Heâs always threatening to me and my brother, âIâLL KICK YOU IN THE FACEâ, âYOUâLL END UP IN HOSPITAL.â Iâve despised him for about 3 weeks and itâs actually a lot better when he drives off and vanishes. Problem is, he makes 80% of our money. My brother is slowly becoming like my dad.Iâm trying to help him, my mum is trying to help him but it isnât working. I believe he can still change because heâs still young (12). He yells at our parents trying to prove he is right all the time. Problem is, he wonât listen to us unless our dad threatens him and scares him into stopping. Heres the big problem, he is a messy person and our mum is a very tidy person, she tells him all the time clean up but he says, âIâll do it laterâ, but never actually does it. So my mum and brother argue often about this. He says he doesnât care about who he is becoming, but I know he does. Despite all the tension between me and my brother I still love him very much. My mum is the only reason our family is still together. She ends up stopping dad from slapping/threatening us and is the one that teaches me and my brother right from wrong. Sheâs basically carrying our whole family and I feel bad about it. I love her very much and I feel so much empathy for her. She was a good daughter and this is the life she grew up for. Itâs sad, really. And me, I was also becoming like my dad, but ever since Mid 2017 Iâve had a fear of me or my brother becoming like him in the future. Iâm using my words, Iâm trying not to yell. Iâm trying not to walk off after every arguement so I can tame my temper. Iâve slipped a few times, but this fear is actually changing me for the better. Iâm telling my brother not to answer back to our parents but he wonât listen. Iâm trying to help my mum because I feel sorry for her. So recently, itâs me and my mum trying to stop my brother from yelling at us, stopping our dad threating/slapping us. Iâm trying to get my brother to see the future like me. So just yesterday, my brother made a light-hearted joke to my dad and he got mad and slapped him. Later that evening, our mum asked him why he did that. So he drove off and came back at 1am. After this, our mum and dad havenât spoken to each other. This morning my brother keeps arguing his point to our mum, I try to support her. My dad has done nothing. All he did was wake up, drove off and come back at 7:30pm to sleep, then he drove off again. So just a few hours ago, my mum tells my brother to clean up. This causes a arguement. I support mum, but my brother wonât stop yelling. I told him to stop 3 times but he told me, âYou donât have the authority to tel me to do anythingâ. After this my mum asks me, âwhat should we do now?â Then I messaged my brother and things have been solved between us. Thats too much arguements for just 2 days, donât you think? And my mum is right, what can we do? Thereâs too much problems with all of us, and weâre all depending on each other so itâs not easy. My mum wouldâve divorced dad long ago if she had the money. I want me, my brother and mum to live together peacefully away from the bad influence of our dad. We havenât called the authorities because my mum is afraid of what will happen to our dad. We havenât got outside help because our parents think itâs embarassing. So, what choices do we have?

"Telling my bestfriend she's long winded without hurting her feelings? My bestfriends and I have been bestfriends for about 2 1/2 years. We met in our college choir and are still in college, just for context. When were at school we basically hang out every night and I love her but when she gets started its like she doesn't know when to stop. I've had to resort to redirecting my attention when she's been going on too long. She tells me the same, or similar stories a lot and has to give me all types of insignificant details that prolong her talking. Even when I bring to her attention she mentioned something before it usually never stops her from telling me again. It does get kinda awkward when I have to ignore her but it hasn't stopped her from rambling. I just don't want to hurt her feelings because I know she talks to me because I'm one of the few people she feels this open to drain everything into. Any advice?

"My husband is not my best friend. Friends jealous of friends. My husband isnât my best friend and thatâs ok. In fact, itâs more than ok. Yes, he is my friend but our connection is deeper than that. We are building our lives as one. Sharing our day to day, filling them with constant support and security. I love my husband deeply but we are also different people. He plays video games and I do arts and crafts. He watches war movies and I go to brunch. I value my friendships &amp; consider them a priority in a different light than the priority my spousal relationship takes. Because of our many differences, I take and make the time to build on my friendships. If their partners are their best friends, I am truly so happy for them. What a beautiful thing to find. However, I tend to notice that those are the friends that often get jealous of my other friendships or the plans I make with others. I hope that I make it clear how much they mean to me because that is all I can do. I donât have a live-in best friend. I donât spend all of my hours or all of my days with my partner. I have different people in my life for different reasons. I love them all. I think my biggest insecurity/worry is that feeling that Iâm sometimes expected to put my life, needs or other friendships on hold while those with âpartner bffsâ hang out with their bffs. Not everyone can understand, so I have to teach myself to let go of the guilt. Truthfully though I just reaaaaallly wish my friends with bff partners could understand so theyâd stop getting jealous. They want me to be and still call me their best friend but they already have one. We were âbest friendsâ till they found their partners and I harbor zero resentment for that, all I want is happiness for all of us. Sure you can have more than one best friend, but I simply donât take their priority anymore. But so I have to move on, ya know? I keep in touch and try to maintain our friendship but when I get closer to a different friend it angers them in a way. If I make plans for a trip with a different friend I am ridden with guilt. Do I just tell myself to get over it? Iâm doing my best? I know thereâs nothing but love on my part. So itâs not truly my problem, right? (Easier said than done with that mindset though) TLDR: my friends boyfriends/fiancÃ©s are their best friends. They get jealous of me getting close with or making plans with other friends while theyhangs with their bff partners. Not my fault right?

"Am I being paranoid? I joined Girl Crew a few months ago. For those who don't know, it's basically an app for women to make friends. A few of us girls met up twice and have a group chat. We're planning to go to a rally tomorrow, and we all expressed our interest in getting a drink afterwards. Two of the girls tagged/mentioned the others in the group in something on FB - places to go for drinks. Both times I was not mentioned, despite saying that I'd like to go. So, am I being paranoid? Or do I have a right to be upset? Rationally, I shouldn't be. We don't know each other that well, so they can't hate me yet. But I don't know. I didn't make the best first impression, so maybe they don't want to be near me at all. I might not even go tomorrow; I might remove myself from the group chat/delete them off FB. What should I do?

"My Boyfriend Talks Daily About Suicide -- Won't Go To Hospital Hi guys, I'm really just at a loss for what to do. I am absolutely gutted. My boyfriend has pretty serious depression and is in dire need of help. I won't be able to get him in to see a therapist until next week. He has recently become quite down on his luck and he hates himself for it. His anxiety stopped him from going to work, and he was fired. He has a new job now, but he hates it as it is a factory job where he works 60 hrs/week. Any time I try to help him find a new job so he can leave this job, he completely panics and shuts down and I can't say anything or else he yells. It has gotten so bad recently that I dread waking up in the morning because of the psychological warfare with him. He will do things like saying he wants to self-harm, or he is going to jump out of the car while I am driving. I have been with him for years, through thick and thin. I have had to bring him to the hospital before, and he did get better for a few months. He told me tonight he doesn't want me to pick him up from work, and that he wasn't going to come home. At this point I feel completely lost, and I know calling the police won't help. I feel trapped and I need to get out for my own health, but I am deathly terrified he is going to kill himself if I leave. He told me I am the only thing holding him back from killing himself. I'm scared. He is such a good person when he isn't feeling this constant depression. I don't know how to get him to understand we just want to help him. He shuts me down every single day, and it hurts knowing he has given up on himself. What can I do to help him until he can see his therapist next week? I want to leave but I am so scared he will kill himself if I do.

"God giveth and God taketh away, but lately he seems to just be taking from me. I'm tired of it all now. A little over a year ago my Grandfather who lived with us passed away. About 6 months ago my mother passed away. A week ago my father went into the hospital to have open heart surgery done on him, and today he came back and is definitely looking worse for wear. For the time being he can't do anything physical, can't drive, and just looks like he's in pain, and is talking about probably retiring. Meanwhile in my life i'm struggling between choosing to go off to college or getting a full-time job. Only just a week ago I was getting ready to start to apply to FAFSA in preparation for actually starting college this year -- now with recent developments i'm not sure if that's even a viable option. I'll probably need to stay home and help out by getting a full-time job since both me and my brother are reliant on my dad financially, and my brother is already in college. I really don't know what I want to do or what I even can do. Add onto more shallow but personal reasons for me to feel down, like the fact that I have no social life to speak of and honestly it's enough to make me seriously consider suicide. It all just feels hopeless to me, and I don't even really feel like living to see what the future holds because it feels as though it's all bleak in the long term.

"I've had no energy to do anything the last couple of days and I'm really struggling to get out of this funk I've had problems with depression for years so none of this is new to me, but I'm having a really rough couple of days and think I'd like to just talk with someone. Today is the second day I'm missing classes. My first one starts in an hour and I live too far away to get there in time at this point. I couldn't get out of bed, and had the same problem yesterday. I just get this feeling of dread when I think about getting ready and actually leaving, and all I feel like I can do is lie in bed thinking about different ways I could kill myself (I'm not going to, it's just something I seem to always end up thinking about in bed, I know it's toxic but it's comforting). I really can't miss any more classes after today, this semester is really important for my grades. I feel like such a piece of shit for missing them two days in a row, this is the exact sort of thing that fucked up my grades last term. Idk it'd be nice to talk to someone, about anything even. I only have one friend who knows I have problems with depression but I don't want her to deal with my emotional baggage.

"Have you ever cried for missing your childhood so bad? Well I often do, quite sometimes frankly. I just miss those good old days, when life was just so beautiful and easy. Nothing to worry about, nothing to cry for other than silly childish little things. My childhood was so beautiful. It was in France. It's been now a whole decade since I left France - the country I've always admired and will always do. I remember going to school, having so many friends, I felt like I'm the happiest child on Earth. Then suddenly one day, everything changed. The passing of time took away from me my childhood, my friends, my beloved France. Life suddenly just changed like that. No more joy, no more innocence, no more real friends, no more homeland. No more beautiful sunny days, only darkness, depression, nostalgia and tears. I'm trying to survive day by day through this hell on Earth. Each time those memories of my childhood flashbacks, I can't help stopping the tears that drop from my eyes. Whenever someone mentions France, I get overwhelmed. I'm living the hardest time of my life. A 10-year ""war in lifetime"", as I call it, still going on, and doesn't seem to have an end soon. I know those good old times are just memories, obviously. Tomorrow when I wake up, things will be just the same. But my hope will never die. My redemption will come, soon or late. This moment of my life will also be just memories, just like those good old days of my childhood in France. I didn't go in detail 'cause I don't think many people will be interested in my story. But if you are, I wouldn't mind sharing you the whole story, as long as you can share me yours. And how about you? Have you ever cried for missing your childhood so bad?

"There truly is no hope. For any of us. This is the bleakest truth of all. Everything is more complicated than you think. You only see a tenth of what is true. There are a million little strings attached to every choice you make; you can destroy your life every time you choose. But maybe you won't know for twenty years. And you may never ever trace it to its source. And you only get one chance to play it out. Just try and figure out your own divorce. And they say there is no fate, but there is: it's what you create. And even though the world goes on for eons and eons, you are only here for a fraction of a fraction of a second. Most of your time is spent being dead or not yet born. But while alive, you wait in vain, wasting years, for a phone call or a letter or a look from someone or something to make it all right. And it never comes or it seems to but it doesn't really. And so you spend your time in vague regret or vaguer hope that something good will come along. Something to make you feel connected, something to make you feel whole, something to make you feel loved. And the truth is I feel so angry, and the truth is I feel so fucking sad, and the truth is I've felt so fucking hurt for so fucking long and for just as long I've been pretending I'm OK, just to get along, just for, I don't know why, maybe because no one wants to hear about my misery, because they have their own. Well, fuck everybody.

"Back to square 1 Depression sucks. I have Been depressed for longer than I could remember. Some days are okay, I could manage to get out of bed and go out. Some days I just want to shut myself in my bedroom, lying on my bed. And then I feel useless and ruminate over the fact that I am in fact useless. Today I feel like absolute shit because the weather sucks. No I am not going out of my home. I don't care if I am running out of food in my apt. I am forgetting all the advice by therapist and wiping out all the progress I have made. I am back to square one. I am such a useless existence on the earth

"I'm so tired. So tired of everything. I lost mostly everything I've cared about in such a short timeframe. My father went from cancer diagnosis to dead in a 3 month time span. My friends don't deserve to deal with me so I've isolated myself. They just enjoy shitposting and memeing, not a pathetic emo child who is literally incapable of being happy right now. One of my closest friends and unfortunately now ex-gf, not only do I still hate myself for how I was but I can't even bring myself to talk to her, I'm just a pathetic waste of a human. All notifications on everything have been off for nearly a week, I don't get on discord anymore. I just feel so alone, so helpless, so very tired both physically and mentally. Even something as simple as having to raid on WoW, my anxiety is horrible with dealing currently and I constantly stress out about people finding out that I'm unhappy because I don't want anyone to see me like this. It's pathetic. It's the only 'social' thing I do anymore and I don't even want to do that. Playing a videogame is too stressful. P a t h e t i c. There is no fixing me I've come to realize, I just accept what is going to happen to me since I know I don't deserve to be happy. Just needed to get some thoughts out, I've gotten about 2 hours of sleep in the last 3 days and it's not for the lack of trying. I just wish I knew how to fix myself when I was still fixable.

Friends can take the place of family and at the end of the day our true friends are always by our side win or lose! Isnât it funny someone not related to you can be so important. Iâm grateful. Always show love to those that take the time to know the REAL you not the person you are in public. Next time you see a true friend cherish every min because youâll never have a better friend.

"Whenever I try to change my life these thoughts pop up Had depression and anxiety for years and have many times tried to make changes to my life. But I can't shake the thought that says: ""why bother?"". ""Why suffer through all that extra pain that change requires just for a long shot chance of a normal life?"". And on top of that I don't even know if I want a normal life! I Often think that the only thing that separates myself from the ""normal people"" (in lack of a better word,) is that the ""normal people"" have an easier time fooling themselves, a bigger capacity for self-delucions. And if happiness can only come from convincing yourself of existential lies, I'm not sure if that (happiness) is for me... Has anyone else struggled with these thoughts? Does anyone know how to motivate yourself to change when it seems so futile?

"What Depression is Like For Me. Having depression is like sailing with a hole inside your boat and only a bucket to keep you afloat. Depression is wanting to have friends but are too anxious to go out and stay a while longer. Depression is forcing yourself out of bed, not for yourself but those who count on you. Depression is having an empty feeling inside your chest while your head is crowded with self loathing. Depression is where people tell you ""it will all get better"" but only hearing the silent whispers of the wind. Depression is where you slowly lose your personality, joy, and interest for those things that you have used to love. Depression is where a stranger tells you ""I'll be here for you"" and you take it as an insult. Depression is where you hurt, crawl on the floor crying, grabbing on to dear life alone in your dark room with your thoughts, too tired to do anything and then go to bed only to rise again to pretend that nothing happened. To pretend, nothing happened.

"Housemate/friend wonât come out of her bedroom and is pregnant So my boyfriend and I moved in with our friend and her bf. We all had this idea of living together, hanging out, have dinner get togethers with our other friends &amp; board game nights etc.. it was all great and exciting but then at day 1 after the move, our friend and her bf just kept to themselves, in their room and hardly hangs out with us. Issues came up with them not helping out with the household chores and when my bf and I brought it up, they got defensive. Then our friend informed us that she is pregnant which changes the dynamics in the house even more as they now plan to get out of our shared lease early. That leaves us to figure out how to pay for the remaining months and look for a replacement. Thatâs fine, itâs their decision to have the baby. But then immediately after that announcement my friend just literally stopped talking to us, she wonât leave her room, and she would have her bf bring food to her room. In a rare occasion that she comes home while weâre in the living room , she doesnât say hi or talk to us. I am really confused and hurt because I feel like Iâve lost a friend that I used to know. Now, itâs been a few months since I talked to her. Sheâs there in the other room behind a wall and it hurts that this is how we have to live. I honestly donât know what to do.

"Torn. Need advice... Hey Reddit. I am not sure how to start all this but im going to explain to my best ability. Here goes. So, i have i had depression and anxiety give or take 3 years. I recently opened up about it to my girlfriend and she encouraged me to open up about it to my mother. I told her about almost everything. The one thing i did not mention to her was the... suicidal thoughts. Now, for our family âfeelingsâ isnt our thing. We keep everything closed up and then repress it all. Thats what i have been doing for years not just with depression but everything. Now, these past three days have been brutal on me. I had no want to leave my bed or eat or even sleep. I just lay there and listen to music. I have been having suicial thoughts here and there these past three days. I will have happy moments here and there. But it doesnt last (shocker) and i just go back to feeling like pure awfulness. So, I am a 17 y/o male and I start senior year in August. We are a military family. My dream is the military. Thats all i have ever wanted. I want to follow my brothers footsteps because he is a total badass. All ive ever talked about to people, when they ask me what i want, to do is how badly i want to join the military. I do not think, with my current mental state, that i should go to the military. But i also fully believe that if i dont go i will disappoint everyone around me and they will be disgusted in me and i also believe that i will fall deeper into this dark hole i have been in. I have come to ask you guys, Any ideas on what to do? I am taking a cross country trip in 2 weeks with my brother and I will ask him some things about this and hopefully it will clear my head. Thank you for reading. I forgot to mention. I want to go get help. get put on medication. But the military doesnt accept people who are on anti depressants. What do i do?

"Why is it that I forget information about certain people? Today, I've asked one of my female coworkers about what degree is she going for even though I keep asking that question when I forgot. She told me she's going for a dental bachelor. I've brought up that I've brought this up a bunch of times and she nodded. I felt pretty embarrassed for asking that question and forgetting the answer a lot of times. (She isn't the only one though) I think the reason why I forget is because the front end has a tendency to have its employees to have erratic working schedules thus it doesn't help when some of the employees go to college on their days off. I'm twenty five year old woman who doesn't go to college because I'm not too wild about school. I know a little bit about some of my coworkers, but I don't hang out with them outside the workplace because of many reasons. 1.) I don't always to make the effort to build a relationship with them because I don't have a lot to say except for questions such how's your day, what time are you working til, and anything new. I will speak when I'm spoken to. 2.) I'm usually inside my head thinking a lot. 3.) I look for people with similar interests. (video games, animation, internet, vaporwave, and so forth on) 4.) I usually wait until someone talks to me. 5.) I don't open up to people easily. 6.) My social life is spent more online. 7.) The interests I have aren't mainstream (video games seem to be somewhat mainstream these days) 8.) I have autism while most of the employees don't have autism. 9.) I don't drive due to my fear of disability limiting my ability to drive safety. 10.) I don't talk a lot about my interests because I'm afraid I may obsess over them over and over again due to the point it may annoy co workers. 11.) I don't usually get involved with conversations with co workers because I need to focus on my job. 12.) When the time gets busy, I normally don't talk a lot. Again, I need focus on the job. 13.) I come from a solitary family from my mother's side. (introversion) 14.) I have a fear that I may say something that may offend them. 15.) I don't always have the motivation to socialize. 16.) I don't talk about my social life with family for reasons. 17.) I come across as serious, thus it doesn't help that I take a lot of things seriously I'm currently looking for free volunteer drivers in my area so I could get to places and make and keep friends. Thankfully, I have someone at home to take me to work, but not always available to take me. Thus I can get to work by walking. (My town is somewhat walk-able) Back to retaining some information about co workers, I remember them I like some of the facts about them. I will put the first letter of my names of the co workers for privacy. Example: B is big on cats, she has an eighteen year old daughter who used to have a pet bunny long time ago. She also love chinese as much as I do. C loves to play video games just like I do. He doesn't like the customer is always right policy. I have a fifteen minute break for every five hours I work. The breakroom tends to vary with there's no people to there's lots of people. Some of the co workers I know use their phone to browse on the internet while eating, and I don't want to bother them while they browse on their phone. Let's face it, it's getting tougher to socialize in real life when internet's taking over everyday life. TL;DR I'd like to know why I lose track of facts of particular co workers and what could I do about it.

"Leapfrogger/Friend Stealer/Friend Poacher etc. Just for some context in my form group (like a morning register class or a house class as some call it) I sat at a table with people I didn't really talk to, but since I couldn't change seats I decided to make some friends with people at the table. In grade/year 8 or 9 I met two guys who are now great friends of mine, one I talk to more than the other since he stayed at home instead of at school due to health issues. Fast forward a few months and you have the situation above. So I started talking about a common interest with this guy we shall name Manny, now Manny and I only talked in form, and after I would go back to my main social circle with my best mate. After a while (about grade 9-10 maybe) I decided Manny should go and chat with me and my best mate's social circle for once, so introduced them both to each other, and they got on well. Now between year 10-11 I definitely noticed that Manny started taking more of my best mates interest, which makes sense and happens often so I didn't think of it. It only caught my attention when my best mate stopped inviting me to events such as hangouts at the park and going on cinema trips with my other friend who stays at home. Instead he would invite Manny and Manny would invite him and some of my other friends to many events like the cinema and sleepovers and whatnot. Over time I would be completely excluded from my friends activities and everytime invited them to do something, they would say ""im not sure if i can go"" only for me to find out they went with Manny somewhere. Sure we are all still friends but I feel like i'm being slowly excluded. Is this just me? What do you all think?

"They told me that all they can do is replace my hard drive, but they can't recover my 10 years of bitter-sweet memories. So I bought an external hard drive, thinking that everything would be safe on it, right? If I'm gonna spend $50 on something, it should at least be good at something, right? So I exported every thing from the past 10 years onto it. Recently, my computer can't even read the hard drive anymore. I went to the customer help service and they said that they can't do anything to access my data and all they can do is replace it (within warranty).

"Whatâs the point of coming up if youâre gonna go down? I moved to a new city with the love of my life after 5 years of loving him. I was ready to propose, I looked at rings, I called jewelers. I debated getting a ring of meteorite, you know? Heâs super nerdy, super cute. Science geek and all. Iâd like to think every guy buying rings thinks about the meteorite ring haha. Then he tells me that he feels like a she. I loved her no matter what. I told her I still loved her and that sheâs going to be one of the most beautiful girls ever. I still planned to propose. I loved her more that sheâs her true self. Then my heart gets broken. She tells me that she canât see a future with me together. She tells me that sheâs only interested in women. There wasnât much for me to do but respect her true feelings. I couldnât force her to love me. For a few weeks I lost my best-friend and my future. We still lived together, music helped, weed helped. I made friends. I tried to be happy, and for a little I think I really was okay. But it was so stormy, one tip of the scale and I was back to being broken. Then I find out that sheâs seeing other guys. My heart was gone, the only feeling is that feeling when your heart drops to your stomach. Itâs a little harder to swallow, did life get harder? Did she make it easier? I donât know. I wasnât good enough for her. She says otherwise. I know she means the best for me with her heart but man, did it hurt the same. I ask her to give me time, as a roommate, as a past lover, give me time to heal before you see someone. Please, just give me some time to heal. But she couldnât wait. I donât blame her, sheâs discovering herself. Sheâs beautiful. I never had a chance. There are better men for her. Iâm broken, the pieces stomped on. I try. I go to work. I exercise. I eat healthy. I tell myself âimprove for yourself and no one elseâ. Itâs a lie. Life seems to drag on, I try to smile, I miss my best friend. I try to act like everythingâs alright to her. She canât be seeing me like this, it hurts her too. I meet a guy. Heâs cute, a little simple, but cute. We start to hang out, workout together even. He takes me to some of the most beautiful places, I try to swallow my doubt and bring my heart back. Somedays, I could swallow just fine around him. When I was sure I was ready, I told him. It was too late. I took too long. I was just dead. I made plans, wrote good bye letters, planned that my little siblings would get what money I had left. I know itâs selfish, I know it can get better. I even tried to find a program that sends emails at a certain time so everyone could get a good nights sleep before they received my letter. I couldnât do it. I stood on the edge of a bridge, the edge of a cliff, wore my favorite clothes. Listened to my favorite songs. Every time I couldnât do it. You never think of it as someone being brave. But I was scared, I couldnât imagine how anyone took that step off, pulled the trigger, kicked the chair. They had to be brave. And now, Iâm back. Iâm ready to kick the chair, Iâm ready to pull the trigger, Iâm ready to jump.

"Depression and grief I am a 28 yr old M, who has been diagnosed with treatment resistant MDD from the age of 16. Recently, I was attempting to get into a ketamine study in a NYC hospital and was asked a number of questions about my background. One item which came up that I have not thought about in a while was the specifics of my uncles suicide when I was around 13. My uncle was a 28 yr old gay M, developed HIV and killed himself. Though this is not what I was initially told. It took around 10 years with every year or so getting a new piece of information. Initially I was told he had cancer and died. Then I was told he had cancer and my grandparents ""pulled the plug"". Then I was told he was gay, had cancer, and my grandparents ""pulled the plug"". Then I was told he was gay, had HIV, and my grandparents ""pulled the plug"". Then, finally, I was told he was gay, had HIV and killed himself. I think I secretly had an understanding of how he had killed himself even when I was a kid and was not told due to subtle hints that kids will typically pick up on. Even if I did not, I always had the feeling that something was wrong and that my parents were not truthful. After discussing his death for two hours for the study, I realized that the depression I have been feeling for over 12 years is so similar to the feeling I get when I think of my uncle. Intense grief. I delved into the feeling more and have not been able to stop crying for the past few days about my uncle. Does this make sense from a psychological stand point to be greiving for this long? I know there is no time limit on emotions but does it make sense for my depression to be as a result of shoving down his death and holding onto it for all this time? I would love to hear some thoughts and opinions. I dont know exactly what I am looking for by posting this but I have really been struggling with the emotions I have been having and would appreciate some guidance and if not, some affirmation.

"School failure I think I'm doing something wrong. I found myself in a situation where I was lucky to move to prosperous country. Except I'm 27 with no degree, no proper work experience, just some odd jobs. I'm an embarrassment compared to other immigrants. Last year I began studying for the first time since high school , just to realize the field does not interest me. I barely even understand the language. My GPA is horrible. And I can't change schools for at least another 2 years due to family. I can't even get a job because my town has almost none, and the ones it does have are given to the natives (I'm foreign). The welfare covers my expenses for now but this is not a life I want to live. I'm also anti-social and seem to fit the symptoms of ADHD, but my therapist claims it's just anxiety disorder and doesn't wanna prescribe any meds yet. I do have a serious learning struggle even when language is not an issue, I can't seem to grasp the concepts unless teachers spell it out for me. Basically I'm unable to learn anything the moment it goes past the basics and it's rather depressing.

Im trying to get better/improve but I just want a way to cope and feel better. Theres no need to suggest anything else. Ive either tried it, wont try it because its not for me, or due to my circumstances cant do it. I thought I could just start drinking again. Atleast until things get better. Im confident that I can stop if/when i need to im just thinking about the health effects.

"My bio dad died and his family didnt tell me until 3 days later... Him and I were never very close. Probably an understatement considering our only interactions were him calling drunk and calling me dirty names since the age of 14. I believe it started at 14 because I had sent him a letter wanting to have a relationship with him. I just wanted to know my dad even if it wasn't a super close relationship I still wanted one. Well fast forward 6 years later he's in the hospital for nearly a month and no one tells me, not even his sister who I am in contact daily with. Finally he passes away last thursday. He was intubated and couldn't speak for most of his hospital stay. He was 39. I asked his side of the family why nobody told me he was in the hospital or why nobody told me died the day it happened. Their reasoning? I had vented at a few points saying I wished he was dead (normally after he would call me drunk and call me a whore and talk shit on my mother who raised me since birth). I am also not invited to the service. Should I feel duped? Should I feel cheated out of a chance to say goodbye even though we weren't on the best of terms? Because his family and girlfriend sure as hell made it clear i don't even deserve to grieve. All i wanted was a relationship with him and all I got was name calling and him taking me and my mom told court over the $200 he had to pay in child support each month. I wasn't very nice to him, I tried to be.. But he made it so hard. So was it really they're call to say I couldn't see him. Or am I right to feel this way..

"Roomie read a text I sent about her on another friends phone So I'm gonna delete this right after but I kinda fucked up bad... I'm a 24 yo female btw living in an apartment w 4 other ppl. Ok so I came home from a stressful night and one of my roommates was drunk af, I left to go see a friend for a bit and when I returned there was a pot of mac and cheese sitting on the stove with the burner on high and no one was around... turns out drunk roomie started cooking then abandoned it there. What annoyed me more was that it was my mac and cheese she cooked and burnt. I understand we get drunk and we take our roomies food... it happens ok, I've done it (rarely) but yeah it happens. I was mainly annoyed that the stove was on high and left unattended while she went out partying! If I wouldn't have come home it could have started a fire. SO me being the idiot I am, I sent a text to our other roomie just explaining that I was a bit annoyed that our other roomie left the stove on and was also using my food wo asking. It wasn't shit talking in my opinion, as the text legit said.. ""I just came home and _____ left the stove on and burnt food and left it there and it was also my food so I'm a bit annoyed"" Me and said roomie had been talking earlier about how we were a bit annoyed she came home so drunk and loud. I legit just said I was a bit annoyed bc she left the stove on and used my food. But I wasn't like incredibly mad I was just venting bc I know I'd get over it in an hour and just tell her tomorrow not to leave food unattended or ask if she'd like to take some of my food.... SO here's where im dumb.... my other roomie left her phone in the kitchen and the message must have popped up or the other girl was snooping through her phone and saw it.... she then proceeded to text me bitching me out and sending awful passive aggressive texts. I remained calm and mature and just explained that yes I was a bit annoyed, but I didn't send the text to be malicious or shit talk, and that I wasn't mad at her. She turned it all around on me and now I'm left feeling like the mean person. The only person I normally vent to about friends is my sister and no one else.. I don't like ""shit talking"" but everyone gets annoyed and needs to vent from time to time. It's healthy to get it off your chest and I didn't mean for her to see it... also it wasn't a mean text or anything....and also she was the one to disrespect me so I feel I had a right to be annoyed, though I shouldn't have sent that text but it could be a lot worse ... WHAT DO I DO NOW. She's so mad and ignoring me. Ugh.

"I'm getting annoyed constantly by one of my closest friends We've been friends since 8th grade, and she's a great friend, outgoing, funny, smart, the usual. We're pretty close, not absolute besties, but at the level where we can share memes with each other at 3am and not think it weird. But this year she's the only one of my friends from last year that has the same lunch as me, so I sit with her everyday. The problem is her bestest friend in the whole world also has the same lunch, so I'm always the awkward third wheel. I always try to help her when she needs it because a, she's my friend, and b, she doesn't have an easy home life. She never has enough to eat at lunch so I always bring something extra, and she also always needs rides everywhere. She says it's because her guardian is at work, or is visiting other family, is babysitting, but I think her family just doesn't want to give her rides places. I don't mind most of the time, but it's gotten to the point where she almost assumes we'll give her a ride when she needs it, and we can't always do that. She also stopped coming to lunch last week to go practice in the orchestra room, and I never even see her until orchestra class. I know something's not right, but every attempt to figure it out has gone unrewarded. I've made new friends this year through cross country and orchestra, and they have the same lunch I do. I went and sat with them one day, but my other friend looked almost mad when I told her I was sitting with them just for that day. It's okay for you to ignore me most of lunch and then not even show up and not answering me when I ask where you've been, but I can't make new friends and sit with them every now and then? I'm just not sure where to go from here, because I don't want to stop being friends, I really don't, but I just feel like my new friends can be better friends, and friends I can relate to better. I just don't want to do or say something I'll regret, especially because I know her life at home isn't great and she needs friends, but she shouldn't be pushing her problems onto me either

"Can anyone cheer me up? Apparently, my dad used to work in another country. While he was away, my mom allegedly cheated on him several times. The only source of mine is my cousin, who gets the info from my sister. So I guess it is true. And to think about it, she did wear a lot of makeup back then. Not the normal amount I mean. To keep it short, when this hit me, I could not imagine her cheating on my dad. Iâve also heard that they are not divorcing because of me, which is plain stupid. All in all, I am pretty much down, Iâve never thought that she would be capable of doing such a thing. (19 year old guy here)

"Everything has changed... About four years ago I was the typical loner. I was in the middle school. Nobody took me seriously, because my hobbies were not shared by anyone else. I'm from a small town, so it was difficult for me to find someone who actually liked the things I did. At the time I liked things like anime, video games and MLP. I am a 19 year old lass now and I only like video games now. In the final grade of my middle school I met a girl. She was about two years younger but liked the same things I did. I was so happy to finally meet someone like me. We have bonded a lot and she was the first person I truly loved, except for my family, of course. About two years ago we started to get distant. She kept talking to me about things I was uncomfortable with, but whenever I tried to talk about something that bothered me, she told me she was busy and didn't hear me out. It escalated in June of 2016. I started talking to her friends, because they seemed like such wonderful people to me. Then we met up, all of us. She kept crying and making scenes. Few weeks before that, she accused me of liking HER friends more than I liked her. But when we all met, it seemed alright, save for her crying etc... When I got home the next day, she told me off. Really badly. She told me to go to hell, called me all sorts of names and I feared... I feared I would never be able to find someone like her again. I tried to end it. Swallowed sleeping pills and drank alcohol. I woke up the next day in a hospital. I woke up to a text from her. One that said she wishes my mother was torn apart by the girl's dogs... It's been two years. I've gotten better, met friends that helped me out a lot and I will probably never be able to repay it. But this past of mine, it still haunts me. I don't think I'll ever be able to trust someone like this again. I have gotten so cynical and careless about everything... It still hurts.

"Finally got a job, but don't really care. So, finally after about 10-11 months, I got a job. The job isn't a bad one. Quite the opposite, actually. They specifically hired me saying that they weren't looking for someone to just stick for a year and move on; they wanted to hire someone and essentially keep them/train them eventually up to management level in the course of hopefully a year or two depending how well I take it. I said yes... though, mostly out of seizing a good opportunity. I'm not happy, or excited. I just don't care, really. &amp;nbsp; First and foremost, I'm a minimalist. The urgency of ""I need to save and buy a house"", or ""I need a secure career/future"", etc.. is non-existent in my life. Everything I own could fit in a van, and there would still be space left. I'm not exaggerating. I've even contemplated living in one; build some insulation to the walls, lay out some flooring, and call it home. I'd be absolutely 100% comfortable. Anyway~ My point is I actually have no reason to be taking this opportunity. The only thing that really ran through my head was ""I'll probably kick myself in the ass in the future for not taking this"". Considering this is a job that'll eventually lead to a solid annual salary within essentially no time, and requires no degrees or fancy stuff, it was kinda hard to say no. But it was also kinda hard to say yes. I don't have an endgame. I don't have a goal. At best, the closest thing to a goal that came to mind was ""Eh, I'd probably get back into riding, and buy myself a motorcycle or something"". That was it. My mind literally blanks after that. Nothing else is there. &amp;nbsp; I'm not suicidal. I don't go to sleep hoping that I'll never wake up again (though I wouldn't be upset by it), and I don't wake up upset that I'm alive for another day in life. If I had to describe how I feel right now... Everything is in a very, very quiet limbo. It's a very passive depression. &amp;nbsp; The best way I can summarize it is that this world has so much ""noise"", and it's exhausting for me. I get exhausted just from thinking about it. I wish people could just relax, and stop stirring so much motion around. It's always been like this for my entire life. I'm so tired. Everything/everyone has to move around with such haste, but all I want to do is stop. I just want to appreciate the colors. I want to laugh. I want to be happy. But in this world, you *can't* be happy looking at the colors. &amp;nbsp; *You just.. can't.*

"My father may have been a monster after all... Iâll try to make this as short as I can I am a 32/F both my parents have passed my mom as recently as 12/2016. My father was up in age when I was born. My mom was wife number 5 and much younger. So when he passed in 2013 it was sad but he lived till his nineties. My parents each had two kids from previous marriages that are much older then me. My mom got sick and then was dying for a year. I was her caregiver 100% and she lived with me. I worked two jobs had no days off and was a P/T nanny as well. Which made her so happy to have in the house cause she loved babies. My bro and sister are human garbage. They did nothing for her when she was dying, made life horrible for me, disliked my care for her just all around horrible people who pushed me to the brink of suicide. I cut all ties when she died moved to another part of the state and got a promotion. Iâm doing alright now and itâs only been a little over a year. So now I had a brother from my dads marriage but he died in a car wreck in 07. My sister from my dads side is all the family I have left. I love her dearly but she has mental issues that are severe. Depression, schizophrenia, anxiety. We live in different states and I tried to get her to move to my state and she Wont she likes where she is. She lives independently and goes to a day program so she manages ok. Recently she has been upset at my cutting ties with my half siblings her step siblings. I told her I would have no problem with her continuing contact but I would not. Hell my cunt of a shitty sister tried to borrow money from her the majority of the times she called her but still I canât stop her she is a 50yr old woman. But now my fragile sister is starting to not do well she is recalling abuse from when she was a teen. Gang rape at 13 multiple rapes in high school etc. and she said our dad did nothing and noticed nothing Now I know this could be her illness at play but....I think I believe her. She got sick or I should say her schizophrenia came to the front lines in her early 20s after she graduated college and had a pretty damn good job. I wasnât even born yet but my mom was in the picture. (My mom and her were very close) When my sister had her breakdown she described horrible rape and abuse in the middle of delusions and episodes. My mom said my dad thought it was her sickness but as my mom put it the way she described it happening it originated somewhere. Whether delusions morphed her memories my mom thought it happened to her. So now this sister only has me to vent to. I tried to call her case manager but as she is an adult and hasnât been hospitalized in decades she wonât let me speak to her. Iâm going to call her day program and try to speak to someone about her seeing a rape counselor or something along wit her regular treatment. In a way I donât want to deal with something this heavy again and I know thatâs selfish I lost years of myself helping care for my dying father then 100% for my mom I was pushed to the brink of my own sanity And then there is the fact that I think my father did do nothing. I was his favorite and I know I was. He never hit me and my mom but he was verbally abusive. But he favorited me cause I am the most like him. He valued education and ambition and I think he felt my sister failed him being sick along with my brother. He acted as a father and I have good memories of him but he wasnât exactly a emotional or loving person to my mom or at times me. But I guess I got the little he had in him. Now Iâm starting to wonder if he was a sociopath or fuck a damn monster. After my brother who would be said sisters full brother died in what we thought was a regular car accident I found out it wasnât. He was on pills and had an addiction and was telling people this shit will kill me. And from the police report witnesses state he just veered into a pole never hit anyone or anything. Just went into a tree. My fathers first two children ended up like they did and then there is is me. Without my mom would I have been something different? While I pulled myself out of the hole I thought I was in, I havenât done well in dating or making friends in my new city. before my parents illnesses I was good at it. Iâm afraid Iâm doing ok with all these losses because I am like him. Through my job Iâm booking sessions with a therapist but im still scared to pick up the phone when my sister calls I know I sound really selfish

"Dealing with a narcissistic mother Ok. I live at home after graduating from college with my mom because I'm in the process of planning my career and finding a job to move out eventually. The thing is its like being in hell when you have a mother with clear mental problems bullying you all the time. She constantly needs attention and if she doesn't get it she changes the locks or threatens me with an eviction notice or tries to remove all the food from the house knowing I don't have anywhere to go and I'm doing all I can as fast as I possibly can to move out. I don't eat much because even if I consume a dollar to 4 dollars worth of food a week she still says I'm eating her out of house and home. I work on my portfolio from sunrise to sunset daily so I'm in my room 90 percent of the time but she accuses me of being secretive because she can't know every little thing I do. She doesn't believe in boundaries and my mental health has suffered greatly because of it. It is now to the point where I've become severely suicidal at times because I feel as if every step I take to start my life away from here she pulls me back 5. What should I do? I have no where else to live or go.

"My Father and Step-Mother sound like they will be getting a divorce. I have three half siblings whom I'm relatively close to, two of them are teenagers and still under their parents' care. Anyways long story short it's my father's consumption of alcohol that's causing the damage. He does well for awhile then doesn't and it's been going on like this for years. Unfortunately my father and I aren't that close. It almost feels like we're walking acquaintances inside the same home when we have dinner together as a family. He seems distant to everyone in our family as well, it can be hard for him to open up. I think my father is really depressed, but he refuses to see a therapist or anything like that. He may be going through some sort of (late) midlife crises right now. He still works his job and apparently brings home enough money to support his family. My step-mother took me aside and looked worried about her situation. She expressed that she may need to get legal help, and is concerned about protecting her children. At this point, I'm going to try and open up to my Dad and just point blank ask him what's going on with his life? He's about to lose his wife of 25+ years and hit a hard rock bottom. I hate to see him do this as he's been a pretty good Dad overall, and always provided for his family... at least keeping our heads above water financially. Any thoughts about how to approach alcohol use and possibly getting a stubborn old man to seek help? I know it's gotta be on his terms and everything, but I don't know what else to do. Thanks!

"Despair is the normal state of my life I haven't drank though. I have no urge to drink. I just want to stop. Stop moving. Just end. I keep picturing myself walking out on my job. Getting kicked out of my apartment. Living in my car. That being repossessed. And eventually ending up in a gutter, wrapped in a a blanket but still freezing to death. Just frozen. Not moving, not willing and thus not physically able to bring myself to it. There is no point to it. It's never enough. Not matter how much you work, how hard you try, it doesn't work. I don't get ahead. Everything I am, someone is better at it. And anything I do, I can be replaced. And if I do find success by some small measure, I acclimate and find myself just as miserable. Nothing has changed. I did a long big post a few weeks ago about all the supposed progress I made. It doesn't bring me happiness anymore. I am so fucking far behind I will never get to a place where I feel safe, so fuck it. I just want to exit. I am sick of being a cog in a machine I never wanted to help built or run.

"I lost my father to a sudden and completely unexpected heart attack two weeks ago. I've been up and down, but right now I'm at a loss. What are some strategies you'd employ(secular wise, i'm non religious). I suffer from severe anxiety(GAD) and severe depression. xpost /r/griefsupport I'm going to seek counselling by the way very soon. My Dad's service hasn't happened yet. I was planning after that to start up again but with this added part. So yeah, my dad showing no signs of it, had a massive heart attack on the 14th and passed away on the 16th at 73 years old. I realize people's times do come, and he had health problems(As far as we knew, no heart disease, had been checked out) but he didn't smoke or drink and he lost a lot of weight and took care of himself for the most part. He was slowing down, but no more then an older person would. To say it was a shock would be putting it mildly. I ugly cried in front of him and his hospital bed several times. I'm just so broken up for my mom and my family. Of course, me too. But my Mom and Dad were married for 45 years. And although it wasn't perfect, they had a true love. And I have such a close relationship with my mother. So when her heart is breaking it's hard for me to see. I sponge it. I feel that pain. I've also unfortunately had to deal with siblings who are dealing with this tragedy by lashing out and trying to put themselves ahead of myself and my brother. (My sister and other brother). And that's been super difficult. They've said some ugly things that I'm trying to look past at the current moment. Anyways, I just wanted to know other then counselling, if there's anything you feel that might be of use to me and my brain to move forward without Dad. Depression has creeped in the last few days with the grief to give it a double whammy. Also had a massive panic attack yesterday as well, which I expected but it never prepares you for it. Anyways. Thank you. Sorry if I seem scrambled. Obviously it's an overload of processing.

"Iâve completed step one Iâm killing myself this year. Not sure when, but Iâm really hoping I can make it happen. Last week, I had a wild night in the shower with a lot of vodka and a razor, posted one last snap on my story with a waving emoji, then went full white noise. No snapchat, no instagram, no Facebook, nothing. Broke all my streaks. Now I have no contact with anyone at all. I avoid the people I know at meal times. I stay in my room and game, or start the long list of letters I have to write to people. The sad thing is, I could have been dead almost a week and no one would know. No one has come to my room to check on me, or message me to ask if Iâm ok. No ones seen or heard from me in days. Iâve pushed everyone away. Step 1 is complete.

"Call me Mrs. Self-Destruction Everything I do is wrong. I was given every advantage in life: intelligence, compassion, athleticism, even looks. I have spent the last 11 years (since 15) sabotaging my own success. I'm now in full self-destruct mode. No anti-depressant works for me. Every medication makes me miserable and sick unless it is a stimulant, and I don't want to be stuck on stimulants. I used to drink as a crutch and now I can't. My husband and I were separated and moved back in together. He is an addict too and going through withdrawal, so he is extra-sensitive. My ex decided that it would be a great time to blackmail me with Facebook statuses and tag my husband in them. I didn't tell my spouse about the blackmail because of the potential fallout, because things were finally good. Now I realize I just hurt him worse. Needless to say... he is pissed. It just makes things worse. I have no motivation at work. Therapy is not working and I need a new therapist, but I don't have the energy or self-love to care enough to do anything about my issues. I am in a black hole when everyone thinks I live a charmed life. I have been depressed since I was five years old and I don't know how long I can hold on without losing it. What do I even do? I'm withdrawing from stims myself, and I feel completely useless and hopeless. I'm too lazy to be suicidal these days, but I don't enjoy life anymore. I cry all the time. I live in my head. I don't know what I can gain from posting here, but someone... please help.

But i still think ive taken more L's in life than a lot of people I see or pass by. Why me? Why this? Guys why do i have go through so much pain in life? Why did I have to witness little boys get bullied, my mom getting beaten to a pulp by some drunk, why do I have to see all of this? I have to fight for my own, thats what Im just now putting into practice. I hate life, people always selling me short, girls never paying attention even though you share every aspect of humanity that you've discovered with them. Coutesy, manners, all dont mean a thing. Im sitting on the pavement, homeless, tired, grumpy, sane, hungry, warm. I hope that I stomp a few people into the ground before I die, because I hate how much shit I've eaten.

"My dad is about to be 65. I'm scared suddenly at the age, and I'm sad because the last few years I wasted and didn't see him enough. He's a very healthy, smart person. Do I still have quality years for us to do activities together? Wondering if anyone can tell me it's all going to be okay in the sense that 65 is not that old, and that I still have time to make memories and learn from my dad at his age. I'm 26. The concept of him having nothing new to teach me and needing me to take care of him now is truly devastating, because it's hitting me how much time has gone by, and just the idea of me being more capable than my father is a bit scary. He's healthy, smart, independent, wise. He still seems the same as he always did except for being a bit more gray, and you can see the age in his face a bit clearer. He drives himself around, works, volunteers, has a long distance relationship. He just seems to be a bit upset and nervous about the state of my life. Like I'm always complaining and yammering about something and it's hard on him. Yet all he wants to do is help me, so he keeps trying, and every time, he just gets put through the ringer and it's hard on him. I feel so bad because I say very harsh things and he's such a fragile person, trying so hard to be tough in this world. And I know shocking the system when you're old is hard on you. So I'm trying to just be mature, put all of the mess behind me, and ensure evevery time him and I are together now, he can see that I'm all good, grown up, and not going to make everything bad for him again. I just want 65 onwards for him and us to be quality bonding time.

"Alienating family Do you ever get tired of saying you're okay when you're not but you don't want to talk about it? So instead you just stop talking to them but then you feel worse for alienating your family and they have no idea why or what's going on with you. My family has never been super close. We get along with each other and talk to each other but we're not a support system and I don't feel comfortable talking to them about my problems. I feel like I'll be judged and gossiped about so I just keep it to myself and as a result wind up pushing them all away. The only person in this world I feel I can talk to about my problems are my husband and I know that's a huge burden on him to be my only outlet, my only friend. It's putting a strain on our relationship and I blame myself for this. It's a lot of pressure to put on someone. Living with a person with depression is hard enough under normal circumstances (whatever normal is) but add the burden of being the only friend, the only person that knows, the only person period. Eventually that only person is going to get tired of it.

I've been trying to block him but he keeps making more accounts telling me to kill myself and that noone cares bout me. he has told me to shoot myself in the head with a gun, drink battery acid and tells me that my friends on PlayStation are no life's for supporting and putting up with me. He also hacked into my friends YouTube channel a while back and took it down thus causing me to have to delete my main YouTube channel and lose a majority of my videos due to him threatening to do it to me too. I can't contact law enforcement as they don't seem to care and he even went so far as to make a fake girl account on twitter and try flirting with me to talk to him.

"not invited to friends party, yet others who barely know her were? so, i wasn't invited to my close friend's party, yet i've known her for 3-4 years. countless people who don't talk to her were invited and so she can't use the excuse of that she had 'limited room/invitations.' also she mentioned to one of my friends, who was invited, that she had sent me an invitation (via text) yet I didn't respond. when it seems as if the text didn't 'go through.' but the fishy thing is that she even made a groupchat. how could a text not go through and how could she forget to add me to a groupchat? I'm just upset and I'm not sure what I did wrong. I don't want to confront her because either she'll get upset, or she'll just say 'it was a mistake.' yet somehow i don't believe it was and I want to know what I did wrong.

"Help: ruining my University course Second year student here in a UK university. I hardly tried at all in the first year, got generally bad grades on my coursework, but revised just enough for the exams to get a 2:1, which is second from the best grade. I also had a few weeks of socialising separated by many weeks of pretty much self-imposed (and lack of sleep imposed) loneliness. So at the time I felt terrible, but looking back on it from second year I had some good memories. Now I'm missing half the lectures, sometimes I don't even go to the shops to get food for the day and have a terrible diet, miss enormous amounts of sleep, and haven't done any work at all. I'm already failing, and even with resits I have to get a ridiculous mark on my tests this semester to even stand a chance of a worthy final score after the 3rd year is over. I feel like the only thing that's gonna bring me out of the depression is the pride of getting a good grade, but I'm way too pessimistic right now to believe that deep down I can even do it. I'm convinced that only 2 friends like me, 1 pities me, and their friends just mock me stealthily. Paid for societies but don't go to any. Feel like a huge disappointment to my family tbh.

I watched a video of her earlier. Happy and giddy with excitement. She jumped around and kicked her legs, unable to contain her excitement. She was so happy and full of enjoyment. But seeing her be so happy without me has put me in a state of deep depression since. Even typing though his out is painful. Knowing I'll never be with her, whilst she lives out her life happy and free makes me feel down to no end. I'm so miserable, I can't even describe it. Why am I even here? As if venting on the internet is going to change anything. I wish she'd love me.

I've had a bad home situation for a couple of years now, it's not getting any better soon. The constant I'm talking about is my boyfriend, my supportive supportive boyfriend. But recently he moved overseas and now we for talk 30 mins everyday. My friends are all attending universities while I'm here waiting for the dream I've always had. I've had suicidal thoughts when I was younger, I googled it one day and mistakenly I told my friend. She got so fucking serious. So then I told her it was all a big joke. And it eventually started to look like one. Nowadays, it's getting harder to cope up each and everyday. I can't seem to concentrate on my college apps. I'm not a suicidal person, I just need the happiness I crave. And being negative isn't helping at all. I just want to be happy again.

I have a small family and I am very close to my dadâs side. I donât feel like i have much ties to Canada except for my dad, his wife and my grandmother. I also have a young niece on my motherâs side (me and my brothers donât have the same father). Iâm scared of missing out on my niece growing up. Iâm scared my grandmother will get sick and i wonât be there fast enough. Iâm scared of the same thing for my dad. Heâs still in a very good shape but iâm his only child. Most of all, it makes me realise that i wonât really miss my mother. I love her but i am not close to her in any way and we donât really get along. And i know she will make a big deal about me leaving even though weâve never had a real relationship. I feel bad about this. Anyone else in that kind of boat? Loving one of your parents less?

He was coming an hour away and he's visiting from out of state so he doesn't know the area. Apparently he was gonna borrow a friends car but wasn't sure all before the game started in a few hours. I was like screw it I'm not dealing with this. I basically convinced him not to go saying it was too expensive and that you'll get lost. I was being honest and he agreed. I wasn't gonna wait for him not knowing when he would arrive. I still went and I don't care. Sometimes you just have to be selfish and look out for yourself. Others can hold you back.

For example, if I do something that irritates My friend she tells her other friends about this instead of taking it up with me. Recently we had a fight and I know she has been telling some of our mutual friends about it. I firmly believe that if two persons have a problem they should talk it out between them without having to involve other people. This way of acting is only driving me further away from her.

"It's extremely difficult for me to cry. I used to deal with depression through breaking down and crying at night, and it was a really helpful way to out all the negative emotion, and I always felt much better after. For over a year now, it's been extremely difficult for me to cry. Unless I'm pushed to the absolute edge, when I feel like I should be crying it's more just a feeling of emptiness. This means that I feel like I can never release my feelings, and that it feels really greyscale at times, and on the rare occasions I can cry it hardly helps as it's basically a panic attack at that point. I don't really know why I'm posting this, but does anyone else deal with this? I'd love to hear from someone who maybe has advice on how to handle it. Love all of you :)

"That feeling of good at night, dread in morning I feel good in the evenings, planning etc. Come the next morning it's dread and anxiety. Always had it but in the last three years I've been hit with health, friendship and security issues. It's definitely aggravated this feeling. I have to travel to different places for work. But I dread it now. I'm not in the position to get therapy. I know the issues, not much more than others out there. I've always just kept busy and got on with things. But this dread is getting much worse. I read it has something to do with the brain not wanting to change all the time. Going places etc. Plus health, security etc. So it makes sense my brain is telling me not to go places. But, this is life and I need to work. No choice. Theses days if something negative happens I tumble rapidly. If something positive I inch up a little. Something is not right. Just wondering how people cope with this?

"How to cope with disrespectful and lying friend? HI I'm new to reddit so please bear with me So this is the situation: My friend and I often interact while playing online games as we're both huge nerds and gamers. I really enjoy spending time with her. However she has this other friend that I really dislike and I would rather play alone than put up with interacting with her friend. I have on multiple occasions expressed my discomfort with her friend and she has acknowledged it but would still invite him anyways without asking me. When that happens I usually just say sorry I don't feel like playing. Sorry for being difficult. She knows her friend will repel me. So anyways after sometime I asked if I can request not to invite him when I'm playing with her and would understand if she said no cause I realize it's a selfish request. She said it's ok no problem. So then we proceed to our routine and there's no issue whatsoever. I told her if it's too difficult to say no or your friend keeps bugging you about it I can go as I didn't want to make it difficult with my own selfishness. The problem a rise when she invited a mystery friend with different name. I suspected and knew that it was her friend that I disliked so immediately asked who that was and she said it's just a random. Not happy with her lying I went off to calm down and confronted her about it, trying to be as clear and straight to the point as I can. I expressed that what she did was hurtful and disrespectful in my point of view. I told her I'm not pleased at the fact she lied even when I called her out. So I said it's on her to resolve this issue. She replied saying there is no issue and what she did was fine. Saying it wasn't disrespectful and its not a big lie plus it was to see if I would even notice its her friend. Long story short she said if it was her she wouldn't be angry cause she's a grown up and that I'm being immature and childish by blowing things out of proportion over such joke-trivial matter. So this is more or less the situation and at the moment it's not good. As she thinks I'm in the wrong and she's right. I have considered the fact that I am wrong and have asked for an outside opinion but all my friends are just angry at how she's treating me. I understand that she can be friends with and spend time with whoever she wants. It's her life afterall. I'm not making her choose cause I know it's selfish and wrong so I'm choosing to remove myself in that situation as it's the only thing to do besides putting up with her friend. My problem is the fact that she attempted to trick me to play together with her friend and continue lying about it upon confrontation. Also by doing so I feel disrespected as she completely disregarded my feelings and opinion in the matter. I would have been perfectly fine if she told me at the start her friend wants to play and she can't really say no or she wants to play with him etc etc. In that case I'll just make myself scarce which I have no issue on doing. Instead she resorted to being deceitful with something so simple and dumb. There's quite a lot more so I'll probably update this but this is in essence more of less the situation.

"Uneasy family members I have had a rough and lonely childhood, in fact i do not want to remember my childhood. There used to be daily fights in the house between my mom and dad. My mom used to talk rudely then and talks rudely even now. She behaves differently outside the house and is a complete different person inside the house, behaves as though we are a burden for her. My dad is no angel either, he is arrogant and adamant, impatient and often has anger control problems, never felt close to him when a child and even now. Never felt any love towards my parent, I always had thoughts about running away from them. To add fuel to the fire my Father's mother will try to instigate any fight on any trivial matter between my mom and dad,I stayed all along with her throughout my childhood but I always thought of her as a monster. She never allowed me or my brother to ever mingle with other children freely and we didn't have many friends. I feel suffocated between my family and want to move away from them shift to another place and be independent. I have finished my graduation and still stay with my family but i feel they sap my energy and I am always negative and depressed staying with them. Criticism is a big part of our family, you are not spared if you make even a minute mistake. Appreciation word is not in my family's dictionary. On top of that my family is conservative and my mom is very very conservative in the bad sense. She will criticize other girls and women for wearing slightly short or tight clothes, but if someone wears the same clothes in our family she will applaude it. My father too judges women based on the clothes they wear and how they look, he doesn't spare men either calling them names based on their physical features. I am tired with this outlook and want to leave the house as soon as possible.There is no room for opinion in my family, especially my father who does not want to listen to anybody else and has fought with me on several occasions. He does not spare me insulting in front of other people. I don't feel easy staying along with them and at the same time feel guilty for depending financially on them. I have always felt hate for them in my heart and mind. Though they have provided me with all the facilities they have not provided understanding and love...they never understood me.What should I do?

Everyone else would be so much better off god damn it I'm such a drain. Why do good people have to die while I'm still around? Just take me instead. I'm debating between driving to school in a few hours to try and get the classes I know I'll fail, or just driving off a fucking bridge. I'm sorry for taking attention away from everyone else here who are worse off than my pathetic confused ass, I just needed to do someting to get these feeling out or I'm gonna blow up and scream

"Suppose you also have a teenage daughter My daughter is quite often seen on the phone with her friend since she has her first smartphone. She get used to locking her bedroom when she is out. More often than before she gets home late. I don't know whether she slips out at night when we all sleep. I'm concerned about her. What I only want is to keep her away from the bad influence.

"I need to get my life on track Im 23 year old black man who just graduated from one of the best universities in the US. I've been depressed as fuck for a large portion of the last 4-6 years. I have no money, no girlfriend(or prospects), and no social life to speak of. I had a solid social life in college but had no luck with girls. Made a lot of friends but none that I'd consider great ones. I'm afraid of public expression, if I come out of this shell I'll just be that little underdeveloped, short loser who thinks he's the shit when he's accomplished nothing in life. I'm afraid of what other people think of me, do they think I'm smart? Do they think I'm nerdy? Do they think I can't dance? Do they think I'm too short? Do they think I'm attractive? Do they think I'm gay? Do they think my voice is deep enough? Do they think I'm laid back? Do they think I'm fake? Do they think I'm a pussy? Do they think I get girls? Do they think my dick is small? Do they think I'm dressed well? Do they think I'm shy? Do they think I'm lame for a black guy? Do they think I act too white? Do they notice the awkwardness when I talk? Do they think I speak well? Do they think I ask too many questions? This causes me to lie to the people around me, including my family about little things that it's unnecessary to lie about. To put on this front of fake confidence when inside I feel like I'm not worth shit. I blow off my friends and then justify it to myself that I'm somehow too good for them. I don't pick up phone calls from family members and try to keep to myself. I just do nothing all day and wait for shit to come to me. I'm not the guy that gets girls, when it comes to trying to actually start a relationship with a girl my awkwardness and lameness just begins to show itself and she immediately senses it and can tell I'm not shit. I've had sex with 2 girls in my life and couldn't actually bust a nut for whatever reason. I'm an asshole to the people around me that do really nice things for me but somehow my brain keeps justifying my behavior and I keep doing it. I can't bring myself to do anything that is remotely productive or will help me better my life. I'm self aware to the point where I know I'm being a complete piece of shit but I can't find the motivation to turn it around. It's like my brain telling me I'll be content just living in my parents house until I'm fucking 60 years old. Somehow when I look in the mirror I see myself as an attractive man, I just look super young for 23, people say I look as young as 16 so I'm also self conscious about that which also makes me put on this facade when I'm around people. Recently for long stretches of months I just go completely ghost and don't leave the house or do anything of use. On the bright side I've had many positive experiences in life where I've felt my potential as a person start to become realized. I have a degree in communication studies from a top 15 university in the US. I have a family that loves and supports me (but probably wants me to move out just as much as I want to move out). This is all pretty incoherent and stream of consciousness but my brain is just really jumbled right now and I had to vent. I need to turn my fuckin life around.

"Should I reach out to her or leave it alone? (TL;DR) I had a friend and it ended pretty bad IMO. Iâve really missed her over the past couple years and I thought about re-befriending her but Iâm not sure. Iâll start with the good things about our past friendship: -she was pretty sweet to me. Very supportive of most things. -She stood up for me when like half the school picked on me for having a 2 foot bright orange Mohawk. -She tried to keep me from dating a pretty Toxic boy (but at the time I was young and wouldnât listen) -She made me walk around the entire town with her frequently (helped me lose the weight Iâd gained and build some muscle in my legs) -She was for the most part a great friend Now the bad: -since I didnât listen about Toxic boy, we ended up dating for about 4 years. Heâs said he didnât like her cause when they went to school together she flirted with him and when he kissed her in the hallway she told the school he sexually assaulted her and got him sent to juvie. Now while Iâm not gonna go into the semantics of whether or not it was s. Assault in anyway, I will say she fully apologized to him and me for it a while back but he made me tell her that we didnât accept her apology and to âfuck offâ -She borrowed a couple box sets of shows from me around this time, those sets were given to me by favorite aunt when I was young. When I wanted them back she claimed she couldnât find them. Almost a year went by of her âlookingâ for them, and I told her (mostly from Toxic boy pushing me to) if she didnât find them by the end of the week I was going to call the police and report her for stealing them. She gave them back to me a couple days later (scratched, though I donât know if she knew they were scratched) -I also shortly dated, and quickly broke up with one of her brothers last year (our personalities didnât really mix well) but I donât think she holds it against me The manority of us breaking up was due to Toxic Boy (heâs he was toxic, he tried to fuck literally any girl friend I introduced him to) pushing me into breaking up with her, telling me she was the toxic one cause she didnât support our relationship and cause of the juvie thing from years before. In 2015 she reached out to me on Facebook saying: âHey i know your probably the last person you wanna hear from but, i just wanted to say im sorry for all the bullshit that happened when i was still in school. If you don't wanna be friends thats understandable, just know thats not me anymore, and im sorryâ Which, of course, Toxic boy made me to reply incredibly rudely to and our friend ship just kind of died. So I need a second, strangers, opinion. What do I do? *TL;DR: Toxic (now ex) boyfriend made me ditch abrasive friend, do I rekindle friendship?*

"Red-pilling my son Little background, I have two ""sons"" (both Eurasians) one is just about to turn 18 and one has just started high school (13) He is into stuff I would consider for lack of a better word ""Beta"" his interests include puppets and Lego, I've tried to takes these things off him and force him to enjoy some more grown up things but my ""wife"" keeps giving them back. So I know he's going to struggle with women in high-school because he is super beta and will definitely put them off with his interests and his racial condition. So I'm asking if their are any fathers who have ""red-pilled"" their children about women and what the best process of introducing red-pill philosophy and sexual strategies to my beta ""son"" I am thinking he's the right age as now he is beginning to notice girls, I bought him some nudie mags and I know he's been checking them out if you know what I mean, so I definitely think the time is right to give him the red-pill!

"Is it okay to be tired of pretending everything is okay to spark optimism? So I have alot going on in my life -- too much for me to want to spend five hours writing about it for this post. What's bothering me is that lately, things have been weighing down HARD. My patience is paper thin from years of abuse and I feel like in these last few months, I'm receding into myself because I don't have patience for even reasonable flaws in other people. I'm tired of being stepped on and dealing with the hand I've been dealt in life (I am CLAWING my way out of poverty ALONE, caused by a narcissistic parent kicking me out and attempting to kill me at 17 -- just made 21). I finally told my boyfriend today, not mincing any words, that I'm so fucking tired of being optimistic. That I'm tired of pretending anything is going to be fine because alot of the times I feel like it won't. ""Faking it till you make it"" has worked for me in the past, definitely, but being optimistic to KEEP myself from being depressing/depressed is not fucking working for me. It's idiotic. It's not that I think things are 100% pointless -- I'm working on a set of skills right now to get myself out of my minimum wage job to get a much better one. &amp;nbsp; But I'm just exhausted from trying to not worry other people and not expressing how fucking done I am with everything. Is this normal? Is this healthy? Like I said, not giving up. I'm working forward. I just feel like the fake optimism is an extra step and a formality at this point and honestly complaining today made me feel better, not going to lie, as I do my best to not do that because I feel like I'm ""pushing myself on others"" (my situation is so bleak that people almost never know what to say in response anyway because there is nothing close to an immediate solution). But I feel angry and spiteful that people who have been given everything or that can recieve assistance from family telling me how I have to ""perk up"" because It's ""what they do when things are hard"" when their ""hard"" is ""I stayed up all the time in college to study and it's hard"" vs ""I stay up all the time to study my new skillset AND risk my life every day on a chinese scooter that gives out at times to do deliveries in all of the elements to make a wage that isn't even livable, having one or more panic attacks a day because of dangerous drivers"". &amp;nbsp; I also feel bad because my SO is always trying to be an optimist. He's somehow perfected this even being depressed himself. Sometimes that bleeds through but he's usually hyper optimistic and it's exhausting. We've gotten in arguments in the past when he was less acquainted with my depression because if I wasn't immediately cheered up by him making jokes while I'm crying to make me laugh (let me work through my emotions, damn... It works sometimes but not ALL the time, seriously), he'd get insulted and take it personally that a single joke was not enough to change my outlook on life and fix all my issues. I feel kind of like I got a little snippy with him when I complained earlier and kept cutting him off and telling him how hopeless I felt and telling him, emotionlessly, ""I just don't care to be optimistic. I don't give a fuck. What's that going to do? I'm already tired, it's just going to make me more tired"" because I had a feeling that that was where he was going to go with it. I feel bad because he's just trying to help. But I am so fucking tired. So tired. I have a hard time doing anything if I don't think it has a point (Even if I hate a job, I'm still getting paid, and there is therefore a point to it) and I just didn't see the point of doing all this. I think I do to make him happy and worry less about me. But I'm so upset that I don't have the capacity right now to do more things to emotionally keep him comfortable. That's stupid. I feel bad, but that's stupid.

"I'm gonna die a virgin. No one likes me and I have no friends. My masculinity, self-esteem, and sense of self-worth have been destroyed thoroughly and are simply nonexistent anymore. I don't even bother trying anymore, I just wallow in my own sadness and escapist entertainment trying to find a reason to continue living with the fact that I'm worthless. No woman would ever be into me and I'm gonna die a virgin. I can't even find solace in masturbation because whenever I see any sort of porn I go deep into a depression again because seeing two people enjoying each other makes me envious. I have no friends and now I don't think I can make any. I can't make friends with people I don't know how to do anything right man.

"Does anyone else have friends that act like they like you but never text you to hang out or see how youâre doing? I donât have a single friend who will text me to hang out. I always have to start the conversation. Every time we hang out though people seem to enjoy my presence. I donât get it why does no one like me, it feels like everyone is just acting nice but secretly hates me. I try and tell my friends to hang out after a rough week and a breakup, and I just got blown off entirely. Iâm really at a loss because no one gives a shit. Edit: For example I texted a friend of mine iâve known since elementary school if he wanted to hang out. He said sure and he would text me later. He never did. I told literally one of my best friends Iâd been having a rough week and wanted to hang out. He blew me off to hang out with someone else. I really canât handle it.

"I dare you guys to figure this out. So I met rhis girl during fall semester for college. We found out that we went to the same school as each other, but she is a couple of years younger than me so we never really met before until summer. So we started hanging out after class, and a few times on the weekends. She has always had some what of a communication problem and depression problem. However before i knew that there was a tjme where i messaged her and she hadn't responded and a couple of weeks had gone by. I was thinking that I was annoying her. So i told her we shouldn't bftiends anymore. Later finding out that she had communication issues. She literally has like no friends at all which i genuinely believe. Eventually we see each other in public, afterwards i message her and apologize, and wanting to befriends again. She eventually accepts my apology and we're somewhat on good terms. We eventaully hang out in person again and she is talking to me about how her boyfriend never talks to her and that her dad is being mean to her. So i give her the advice that idk her boyfriend but he could possibly be cheating on you if stops communicating as much woth you. But, again stressing idk know him so take what i said with a grain of salt. Weeks go by and she evetnually tells me that our friendshup isn't going to work out, and that nothing good has really came of it. And i should just stkp trying to be friends. This really hurt me i care about her a great deal. She then proceeds to unfriend me on facebook, and snapchat, and tells me to not contact her anymore. I need some helps guys, i feel like i should give het somr space and time to cool down and then i should message her apologizing for everything and that i want to be friends again. But I'm not sure I've never really been in this situation before. Please help me guys, I would greatly appreciate it.

Im a junior in college, I've been single for 5 years, and I struggle with things everyone seems to get. I'm worthless to the world, what do I offer?

I just feel like if I disappeared the world would sigh in relief. It's not like anyone would notice me being gone. I don't have a girlfriend or anything like that, because let's be honest, what girl wants to be with a loser who has to work twice as hard as everyone else. I want to die.

But does anyone else actually manage to feel somewhat okay around particular people, only to go back to feeling somewhat numb when alone? I'm not sure how to deal with this, but when I'm alone I'll do shit like binge eat just to feel something. Contrary to when I'm not alone, and can actually push myself to go and exercise. The snowball effect is real... but man do things feel like a struggle for no reason right now, even knowing that it can get better when socializing. Any advice?

"10 years I've been managing depression and I was doing well, until last Monday. Quick back story: 38/m/Ireland. I was a competitive Powerlifter and represented my country on 2 occasions with great success. My life was lifting; setting goals, reaching targets, smashing PBs...all helped with creating a future for myself. I started to feel unwell around December 2016 and developed a persistent, non-productive cough. Series of tests led me to an echocardiograph where it was discovered I was suffering Heart Failure. Dilated Cardio Myopathy caused by a viral infection, left my hearts function at 20%EF. Apparently I had a few months to live if I hadn't caught it. Ironically, now, I wish they hadn't discovered it. My world flipped upside down. No Powerlifting, no excessive exercise, restricted fluid intake, no over exertion, meds for the rest of my life, regular reviews in my heart clinic, multiple ambulance emergency rides to A&amp;E when my heart goes irregular. Hospital, pharmacy, hospital, pharmacy... Seems to be my life for the past year. Last Monday I snapped. It hit me. Everything I lost came crashing in on me. I got in my car, picked a place I knew well to ram my car into at 120mph. I was screaming at myself to do it. My left hand steering towards the end, my right hand steering me to survive. An image of my dog in my mind kept me on the road. I knew she'd miss me too much. I'm still very low now despite all my meds. I still wish I had gone through with it. I still think of going to the Cliffs of Moher and jumping... What a beautiful place to end it. I'm dreading the road ahead because I know how Rocky it's going to be... Help me please.

I even got somewhat of a friend group but I'm always awkward around any of them when I'm just with them. so, what i'm trying to say I guess is that I'm wondering if ya'll could give me advice on how not to be awkward or how to get people to enjoy/embrace my awkwardness. I don't know man, I just want friends lol. Thanks guys &lt;3

"Was this a true friendship? TL;DR (?) A friend that I have know for 15 years just blocked me on facebook. I have always had feelings for her but I had began to move on. I don't have a lot of friends and I always liked having her as a friend and as someone I could go to. She was willing to do this with me even when she was dating someone else. As she got more serious with the other guy she started to talk to me less and less and she started to not chat with me as much about her life but she always wanted to hear about my problems and woes. I really started to feel that something was wrong when she recently got married. We had talked about marriage a few times in previous years. She had indicated that she was unsure if she would ever get married then she said she was considering it with her bf. Then one day she moved to a the same city as her husband to be but when I asked her about why or if she was considering marrying him she said she moved because she liked it there more. She hid the fact that she was engaged from me but still allowed a friendship. I know that it shouldn't have mattered that she was getting married but I did want to be supportive of it and I also wanted to know because I felt that it would be unappropriate for us to be the same type of friends that we were. One day I called her to tell her some really bad news about something that had happened in my life. I called several times but she didn't answer because she was busy. She finally returned my call at midnight and got onto me for calling her so much and then said ""I can't do this"". Then she put severe restrictions on it saying that I could only talk to her in sever circumstances or to tell her things but she would never initiate contact with me or make small talk with me. I got fed up and told her that it wasn't true friendship if she wouldn't reciprocate communication or tell me about major things in her life getting married. I also brought up some things from the past that made me feel the way that I feel towards her. Then she blocked me on facebook and told me that she wanted to discontinue all communication altogether. I feel like she knew that she had be wrong with me in the past but refused to admit it to me. Was this ever a true friendship? Am I wrong for feeling like my heart was torn out because of what she did? Is what she did OK from her end? Was she wrong or could she have been better about communicating this with me? I just don't know how to process what happened and I feel bad but I still feel that if I am going to call somebody a friend, I should be able to talk to them about life without limitation. I do know there are boundaries but just making small talk shouldn't violate a boundary. I am just looking for validation. I still do care about her as a person. I don't think she's evil but I do think that she doesn't have much compassion for me.

"I think I'm having a nervous breakdown I've struggled off and on for about 10 years with anxiety and depression. The latter half has been mostly on. Recently my psychiatrist changed my medication from Zoloft to Effexor because the Zoloft had pretty much plateaued and then started working less. I don't think the Effexor is having a very good effect on me. My depression has been worse than ever. On top of that I found out that my dog has bone cancer and likely won't live more than 8-12 months. She's only 6 and she has been my entire world since I adopted her and she has helped me through a lot of difficult times. Because of these things my moods have been very bad, and I had to leave work a few days ago and I haven't been back since, and I'm pretty sure they're going to fire me because I'm still new. Although the job was adding to my stress because they failed to tell me that we would be working mandatory overtime EVERY SINGLE DAY. I don't have much of a support system. My mom is pissed at me about work, and I'm living with my grandfather who just doesn't get it. I don't really have much in the way of friends which is I guess why I'm ranting on Reddit looking for some kind of support. I don't really know what to do. I'm going to call my psychiatrist Monday to set up an appointment and hopefully get off Effexor. I want to find a job that is less intense than this one, and less hours. Hopefully part time. I don't know I just need some support/advice/anything.

"How should I deal with this flaky friend? I have a friend who I totally love who ALWAYS flakes. whether the plans are big or small 95% of the plans we make (initiated by her often) end up with ""I don't feel like going out"" or ""i made other plans"" or ""i don't remember making these plans"" etc. This is super annoying and all but it's not the whole problem. Since she's super flaky I always call her out on it or joke about it. for example: In our group chat another friend will make plans and she'll be like ""ok its set"" and then i'll reply like ""that only means it's half set"" and I know I'm being snarky and all but she deserves it for being such a flake! right? Anyway I guess it really annoys her when i do this so she confronted me about it calling me a bitch for always making jokes about her being flaky and asked me not to do it anymore. I agreed but I kind of wish I didn't and now i feel like not even replying when we talk in our group chat. Im sure making snarky comments about someone being a flake can't be anywhere near as annoying as constantly being flaked on, Right? There's been some huge plans that she flaked on including travel and birthday plans that really upset me especially since she's such a good friend and it means a lot to me for her to make it to those special occasions. Does anyone have any advice on how to move forward? Should I just pretend it never happened and continue like usual or should I say/do something? What's your experience with friends like this?

"Poem about mental illness I wrote When you ask if I'm okay Of course I am okay. I am alive, But not quite living. I am okay but I am trapped, Watching those around me Live their lives. I am okay but I feel lost, Or rather I cannot feel at all. I am okay but I am screaming As loud as I can inside my head. I want to be heard But suffer in silence. I am okay but other's are not I make them feel helpless As they watch me sway Between okay and isolation. Isolation from others From myself From my passions. Isolated from my own feelings Sometimes there's nothing left but the dark. You feel helpless? I am helpless I am drowning in the darkness. I am okay But I'm not really here Here or there I'm everywhere My brain can't straighten up. I'm okay but I'm not living I feel trapped within myself. I am not okay.

"Rolling down hill Hi all, It all started last year when I quit my bachelor in Physical Therapy. That study didnt seem right for me and I dropped out in feb 2016. From februari till september I've worked a depressing job in an order picking centre to pay for my next year of college. But after that there wasnt any motivation for anything left over in me. This year I started a new study, lifesciences. It started all fun for the first two months. Because we had the basics of chemistry, anatomy, algebra and physics. But in the beginning of november the second semester started and thus I had tests from the first semester. Failed them all. In the weeks leading to the tests I couldnt concentrate or motivate myself to do anything. I was just at my room doing absolutely nothing. 14 november was my birthday, turned 19. Everyone forgot it except my gf (for 2,5 years). Was a fun day and made me forget the test results and gave me a little hope. Today she told me she was seeing someone else for the last 3 months because I had too little time to see her, because I was always busy with school. Im feeling that everything is worse. My job sucks but I have to keep it as I got to keep up with school costs. Already got pretty hefty debt from those two halve years of university. I just feel that everything that I do fails. Like the last 2 years I've accomplished nothing. I would like to travel if I'm going to have my second gap year but my funds wouldnt allow it. Working would be my only option but the only jobs that are available will push me over the edge. But there is something good at the horizon; there is a small chance I'm getting accepted in to the police academy, but that's only a small chance so no big hopes as that makes it worse.

"Itâs not some fucking sadness anymore. This is madness. I remember when I just had a few days when I felt sad and out of it. And I would worry but then everything became better a few days later. Still, I went to a psychologist, because my downs were too consistent to be considered normal. It all went downhill from there. I feel like Iâve lost a part of myself. My personality, my identity, whatever. I feel like when I talk to others Iâm not âthereâ, like Iâve lost control of what I say and think. Like Iâve lost my mind. Like others are normal and Iâm in my own world, going through life on automatic mode, not knowing what I should think, say, or do. Even though from outside people might say Iâm completely normal, even sometimes better than before, I feel like mentally, inside, the world is going down. My life is crumbling. Like piece by piece I get further away from a solution. Things that seem to work for others donât work for me. I hate it. Itâs not just a âbad moodâ anymore. Itâs feeling like Iâve lost my way, and thereâs no signs to get back. Like a loop I canât get out of. Thatâs why suicide comes up as an option. When youâre stuck in a loop, the only solution is to shut off. If sleeping is the only thing I enjoy, then why wonât I sleep forever? Fuck that shit

"Sleeping to avoid hurting myself Sleeping seems like the only way to keep myself from self-harming. I have bipolar 2 (heavy on depression, light on mania), so my depressive episodes always pass. I just feel like sleeping is the only way to stay safe until it does. My therapist uses medication as a last resort, so Iâm not medicated. I should be, clearly, but sheâs kind of a hippie. Iâm not. If the drugs will keep me from wanting to or attempting to kill myself, then give me the fucking medication. Having a rough week. Just want it to pass.

"Psychiatrist of 6 years terminated me as a patient and is refusing refills of Lamictal because I went to outpatient rehab? I have been going to the same psychiatrist for 6 years. I have been on a high dose of Lamictal for 6 years to treat bipolar disorder. I have gone to regular appointments and have had consistent refills. I had a period of intense depression in which I went on a one month drinking binge and went to a hospital where I was given Ativan to deal with the withdrawal. It wasn't a consistent prescription, just enough pills to ween off the withdrawal and ensure I wouldn't relapse back to drinking. My psychiatrist just called me and told me she is terminating me as a patient and is unable to see me or refill my lamictal because I was prescribed Ativan by another physician. I am freaking out about the effects of stopping this cold turkey. I only took the Ativan for one week, two months ago. I just want to have my lamictal refilled. I need a refill this week, I can't find a new psychiatrist in time. How is this allowed? I sought emergency treatment for a substance abuse issue and am being unsafely yanked off a medicine I've been on my entire adult life. Help please

"I think I'm in an abusive friendship and I don't know what to do. One of my close friends with borderline has been constantly reinforcing and triggering my social anxiety. Everything is apparently all my fault, always, Apparently everyone (whatever that means) says I'm nuts, Im controlling, blah blah. She tried to rediagonse my depression as a narcissistic personality disorder. There's a laundry list of things that have been said to me. It's making me feel useless and sad and reinforcing the notion that no matter how hard I try I will never be good enough, that maybe I deserve to be alone, etc. I feel like I'm going to have to either let her continue to talk to me like this or stand up for myself and lose her as a friend. While the latter option gives me the peace of mind to think it's not me, that I had enough self worth to stand up for myself and not cave to my friends abusive reinforcement, I really don't want to lose her as a friend. I just don't know what to do, she usually doesn't listen to me anyways. I don't know, maybe I am just a dirtbag. Does anyone have any thoughts as to how to get out of this cycle?

"Embarrassing myself at volleyball tryouts I'm a freshman in high school and we just did volleyball tryouts and they were fucking horrible. I had to wake up at 5:30 to go to them because they started at 6. Literally everyone there was better than me. I fucking hate everything. I'm such a failure. Like everyone was doing actual spikes and sets and shit and I was just there. They probably thought I was in special ed. At least if I had a mental disability I would have an excuse to be so shit at volleyball. I'm probably gonna quit tbh. I've never wanted to die more in my life. And I know you're probably gonna say do your best and I am but my best isn't good enough. This is what I get for trying to be less depressed using a sport.

"21/F/US Looking for a long term friend Hello! My name is Mousey and I live in Georgia. Iâve been very busy with school, work, and starting my own business. Iâm looking for people I can have serious connections with. I used to have a best friend in the UK whom I talked with every day all day. So, time zones donât really bother me. I have an open mind, and I love sharing thoughts and ideas with people. I love learning new things (and since I have an awful memory- you can teach me the same thing three times and Iâll be excited every time lol) I am currently studying to be a middle grades teacher in the fields of science and social sciences. I also have a chinchilla and a hedgehog. Theyâre wonderful babies and Iâve had them for a long time now (theyâre my heart) I am pretty blunt and open to receive and give advice. I really want someone who i can share my daily life with, and they can share theirs with me. Funny pictures, goofing off, hard experiences we encounter, the whole nine. I miss having that connection with someone. Iâm not looking for a specific gender, age, or region. I just wanna spend my time and experiences with someone who will become special to me!(: Iâm not sure if this helps or hurts me here- but, Iâm not really into anime or gaming (I thought I would throw that in there because of the people on here seem to enjoy those things) A lot of people also tend to be into computer science, and thatâs okay! But, Iâm going to tell you now that Iâm pretty technologically impaired so I wonât be able to hold a conversation about it with you :P If youâre okay will all of these things then just shoot me a message, I canât wait to meet you!(:

I am not able to study well, yet when test comes, I have no fear of the consequences of the failing tests, even though I am certainly failing it. Same with my other habits, I eat like once in a day, which is an obligation I have put on myself to do at least once. Even then its very less than what any normal person of my age eats. I barely get 4-6 hours of sleep due to my schedule and not able to sleep quickly at night. I know its not healthy, but aren't we supposed to do these things by fearing what will happen to ourselves? I think I have lost the fear of consequences of my actions. Does anyone have this kind of experience?

"Does anyone else imagine their depression as being much more 'dramatic' than it actually is? I always think of my depression as being something quite mysterious and I dramatise it in my own mind. It's as if my brain is just trying to make something of depression, which ultimately makes it worse because it gives part of my brain comfort in depression, as it least it gives me some kind of identity. I imagine it as being this huge struggle with myself, almost like a character in a movie or a book and glorify the worst parts of it to provide myself with any comfort I can. It's pretty toxic but it's one of the only ways I can deal with it, does anyone else find themselves doing a similar thing?

This isn't just like being in a bad friend group, ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE I know has needed a break from me or told me to go away. Counselors who are getting paid to deal with me make me feel like I'm being too annoying. Maybe I'm talking over them too much or I'm too jittery. I feel like people are always trying to dominate me or shut me down. No one has every seemed to seek me out or wanted to be around me. I'm the only person that enjoys my company and that's all I have. I talk to myself a lot. I make myself laugh a lot. This is occurring to me as I'm typing it and I feel like crying. I just want a person I can make laugh and inspire. I want to make a difference in someone else's life.

"Lonely and stupid. I feel so stupid. I've always been academic and studious- if anything, I've dedicated my existence to the pursuit of knowledge, at the expense of forming human relationships. But I'm constantly overwhelmed by how much I don't know, how slow I am to understand concepts, and how my peers are all more intelligent than me. I know it's impossible to always be the smartest person in the room, but I feel that the fruits of my studies are disproportionate to my efforts. At the same time, I have conflicting feelings over my loneliness. I desire human interaction, but others find me rigid and distant. In all honesty, I'm easily bored by small talk and trivial discussions. I understand that it's important in forming friendships, but my under-stimulated brain seems to automatically 'shut-off' after a while. I've noticed that the people I do get along with are like me. Introverted, cold, and academic. We do not see each other as people, but as enlightened books with fresh concepts. These ideas are interesting to explore. If the book is lost, we are disappointed but not crushed. We were never bound by friendship; we were tied by our interests and perhaps mutual isolation. I don't feel an ounce of human warmth from these acquaintances.

"Iâm trying to get communication back with my best friend. I have an idea, it wonât be easy and it may never work, but itâs worth a shot? Long story short: Iâve been depressed and I have a friend. I could make a 5 paragraph story about my friend and my depression. But I want to get to the point. I donât want to make this post too long otherwise no one will read it. My friend made the decision to stop communication with me until I go to a residential psychiatric program or somewhere similar. The thing is Iâve been in one already, it was a pretty flexible place, cell phones were allowed, doors were never locked, etc. Long story short I became âtoo high riskâ and am not allowed back. And I donât want to go back. I donât believe in happiness by mental health, I believe in natural happiness. I believe that all humans deserve to feel happy without being told âyour life sucks so you need pills and mental health treatment to be happy.â So anyways, I canât fulfill his wish. But getting communication back with him is all I want. There are no exceptions. So hereâs my idea. Just for fun I livestream games on YouTube. I do it for fun, not for fame, I donât play those popular games, I play the ones that no one plays. Itâs unlikely for a video to get more than 100 views. But Iâve considered starting a new channel. I will livestream games, post videos about my custom Guitar Hero songs (I do that for fun too) and just pretty much show that Iâm having fun. But the big goal of the channel will be to âget my friend backâ. Thatâll be the whole idea. That will be written on every video. Thatâs what the channel art will say. Think of it as a gofundme, only Iâm not asking for money, Iâm asking for support from the public to hear my story, hear what Iâm doing, and to be there with me when my friend does deliver. Hereâs the catch. For obvious reasons, his name will never be revealed. No one will have any idea who my friend is. But little by little, I will try to reveal the channel to him. Itâll start with the channel being named âIanâ, then sooner or later add my last name. As time goes on Iâll try and find ways to give him clues about the channel without actually telling him anything. The big dream is that he eventually discovers the channel, and with whatever support there is, he will see how much Iâve mentally improved over however long it takes. This all may sound totally silly, totally bogus, yeah, maybe this will never work in a million years. Just a wild thought that Iâm going to attempt anyways. I might edit this post with a link to the channel depending on the response here.

"Husband in hospital and I am at a complete loss Hi all long time lurker first time poster. Using a throw away since it would destroy my husband if he saw this. I am on mobile and a bit sleep deprived, so sorry for the format or dreaded grammar errors. TLDR at bottom. Honestly I donât need advice I just need to let everything out now before i explode. And (un)fortunately my husband is my best friend leaving me feeling alone with no one to talk to. I have a 20month old and am 35 weeks pregnant. My husband for the last few weeks has been feeling nauseous and out of sorts. I finally convinced him to go to a redicare. Well those jerks turned him away since they canât help with abdominal pain. I wasnât with him or they would have seen him. He ended up going to another urgent care. There they realized he had a bp of 220/112. First annoyance if the first place took his vitals we could have headed straight to the ER. We met up and got him there right away. We were at the ER for several hours before they made the decision to admit him to the cardiac unit of the hospital. Since then they have discovered a kidney issue and have not gotten a handle on the bp. They have no answers but seem to be coming up with more questions. He isnât even 30 so the fact this is happening is extremely bizarre. His mother was here to help, but I am at my wits end and needed to be alone this evening. We just moved our daughter to a toddler bed Saturday which is doing great at night but she hasnât napped in 3 days. She is crabby and obviously confused since daddy isnât home. She is also in a phase where hitting mommy is funny. She hit me today and I just burst into tears. Which according to my mil is my hormones which really helped the situation. I canât sleep and am vomiting from pregnancy and stress. I know I have to be strong for her and him and unborn, but I am failing. I spent 2 hours tonight just crying. I keep losing my temper with my daughter. I wish I could be at the hospital with him. I feel stranded, alone and useless. I donât know how I can help him. He is spiraling down into a pit of depression and I have no way of helping him out. I keep calling and texting him which I can tell he doesnât want. We are going to visit tomorrow morning then my mom is going to come here tomorrow so I can go see him again without the little one. But I havenât been home much the past 2 days and I know it is taking a toll on her. I just recently became a stay at home which has created separation anxiety issues. I feel torn between to 2 people who mean the world to me and I am failing both of them. If you made it this far I guess the only question I have is does anyone have experience with this and how can I help him and her get through this? TLDR: Husband has crazy high bp and hospitalized. I feel like I am failing helping him and my toddler get through this. I feel like I have no one to talk to. Being 35 weeks pregnant is not making anything easier.

Every time I'm in the bathroom emptying my bladder and my mom has to go, and she rushes me to finish. It's not like I can't pee any faster, I swear my mom and brother are the only ones in the house who can be rude to me sometimes. When my brother plays his game and I want to tell him about something he gives me an attitude just because he's mad at the game since he sucks at video games (I don't know why he keeps playing the same game that he dies in a lot) or he just plains ignore. I think now I know why I was never happy living at home. A lot of bad things happened to me in the house I grew up in. (it's a long story for another post).I'm more happier away from home than when I'm at home. The only time I feel like I get respected and treated nicely is when I'm with my boyfriend, my best friends, and my other family members. Sadly I can't move out yet since I'm not working at the moment but I'll be working soon and making enough to leave the place I can't even call home most of the time.

"I miss the days where I at least had depression sleep to look forward to. More of a vent here so bare with me. I have not had a good night of undisturbed deep sleep where I wake up feeling refreshed in years. Like, I kinda autopilot through my day trying to ignore how nothing really excites or motivates me and that I've stopped progressing towards any dreams or goals, and the more I'm awake the longer I have to struggle with that and I don't even have sleep to look forward to. I used to be able to sleep through anything and for many hours at a time. It was awesome. Idk, just like I'm riding a vicious cycle of depression worsening sleep, sleep worsening depression slowly downwards to the point where I think not existing would finally feel like the best damn rest I ever had.

"I want to pay off my debt then kill myself. I came from a really poor family, worked hard during primary and secondary school. Got a scholarship for college which paid me 10k a year as well as covering my school fees. Gave parents the money, it paid for the bills as well as my siblings's school fees. Thought life was good, studying what i love. However, i got bullied until i cant take it anymore and requested a change of class, the school rejected my request. I then requested to take a semester off school, but the contract for the scholarship states that i have to complete school by 3 years or the contract will be terminated. Failed a module and i have to extend my time in college by a year, which caused my scholarship to be terminated. Which in turn placed me in a 30k debt. Now, i don't have money to pay for school, so i had to leave. Im out without any qualifications except for a secondary school cert, with the organisation that offered me the scholarship requesting 1k per month for installments. I've always looked forward to my dream job, i was so close, i volunteer every weekend to get experience from that job. Now it feels like everything is taken from me. I appealed to have my scholarship reinstated 3 times, explaining the issues that i had, giving them the medical reports from my doctors, bringing up the volunteer work i did. But on the latest attempt, i got a call saying that they never planned to accept my appeal. It really feels like everything is taken from me. I feel like just working to pay off my debt so as to not burden my family as the debtors will go for them if i die now. There's nothing to look forward to anymore. 3 years of suffering incoming

I feel weak mentally, emotionally, physically, internally... I feel like I can't go on, like I can't keep fighting, like I've had enough... I freeze over, my body locks up, my fear paralyzes me, and my mind becomes my enemy... Night seems endless because I can't see much of anything no matter where I try to look. From minor fears to worst nightmares stalk me like I'm nothing but an insignificant prey who's time has come. I'm exhausted and need sleep, but only nightmares haunt me or the fear of being attacked while I'm immobile by unconsciousness... And yet, though a part of me yearns for light, for the warm comfort of the sun, it only depresses me. In the light I can see what I truly am, I can see a reflection of something I've grown to hate. When I look at my reflection I want to smash the mirror so I can no longer see the truth of my insignificant existence. In the light I can see everyone else, either continuing on with their lives without a thought of me or a second glance. Or I see other people like me suffering and it both hurts and gives me a strange, and possibly, a cruel comfort. I hate seeing other's suffer, but I'm so insignificant I am helpless that I might as well be dead... I need the light and yet it hurts me...

"I've been reading this subreddit for awhile. Well, as the title says I have been reading this stuff for months. I think I'm depressed. I'm not sure why though. I have a really good long-term boyfriend, everything I need and a lot of things I just want. I've been ""depressed"" as long as I can remember. I think about killing myself every day, multiple times a day. Like, ""oh, i dropped something, well better kill myself"" ""Oh, I failed that math problem, you're worthless better kill yourself now"" I can barely shower most days. I don't know why my boyfriend hasn't broken up with me. Sometimes I wish he would so I could just kill myself. I feel really bad for him. I have anger issues I think, My moods change really fast, it is hard to keep up with them and I don't know why it happens. Most days I don't want to get out of bed. I don't have any friends. I always feel like everyone hates me. It would just be so much easier to die, why do people bother with life? What is the point? Everyone has always said that things ""get better"" but they don't really. They change and then something else sucks. Nothing makes me happy, I don't enjoy doing anything that I can do by myself. I hate being alone, I hate my own company. I guess I just hate myself. Is this depression? Do I just suck? Maybe I'm just being dramatic. I wanna be a better person but I don't know how. My anxiety feels like a prison. It's really hard for me to leave the house. I HATE being around people, but I don't want to be alone either. Going to the store is a nightmare for me, the panic attacks and worrying I'm in someones way all the time. I only go in the middle of the night and never by myself. What is wrong with me? Why can't I do things normal people do? Is there any point in existing when you always feel miserable? This is the most awkward thing I've done in awhile, Time to take a nap and forget I posted here. ( I didn't post to suicide watch because I've been having these thoughts so long I don't think I'll ever do it, even though I probably should. I'm just dramatic)

"I donât even want to write this post I just wish I had the fulfilling family experience like everyone of my other friends did. But instead I got a drug addict mom and a emotional incompetent dad who I regularly got into emotional skirmishes a lot when I was younger. Im the product of verbal abuse and emotional neglect and it haunts to every single day of my life. This affects me in ways like not being productive at all when I get close to deadlines, not being to emotionally relate to anyone because my internet sense of judgement and risk management are fucked up, I have self destructive tendencies that I use as coping mechanisms, I hop on the rollercoaster of life and hope and pray sometimes that it would fling me off the tracks. I donât even know if any of this makes sense because of the conflicting thoughts Iâm always having about whether or not I believe or donât believe that this life is worth living. Iâm trying every single day, Iâm trying my hardest to keep it together, Iâm trying my absolute fucking hardest to keep moving forward but I am consistently being stopped or held back by the dread and anguish of waking up to a life that I donât even want to fucking live.

"I've lost 4 Marines to depression and almsost lost a 5th. None saw combat. I need help understanding. Hi. I just had my 4th funeral in 7 years for yet another Marine. A few days ago another one called me with a gun to his head and i talked him down. These 5 Marines, as far as i can tell suffer/suffered from depression. Pretty much every one of them was intelligent (like way too smart for the Marine Corps) and each of them stood out as ""the funny one"". To say very few people understood they were struggling would be an understatement. The Marine Corps has done a lot to try and help suicidal Marines, but all our training videos depict some ""clearly distressed"" person telegraphing an intent to harm themselves. In reality none of these people let on the depth of their suffering and only one made an attempt to seek help. What I'm asking: As someone who has never suffered depression (Ive been ""depressed"" but that was from external factors like a job not working out or a girl leaving me. I consider that normal human emotion), how do I identify Marines under my care thst may be suffering and need help. They are NOT giving the outward signs in the stupid ""Lance Corporal Decker video"" we watch once a year. Thanks. Edit: been at work all day then went to visit a former Marine that dealt with some serious issues in his day but is doing well now. Mulled over a lot of this with him, then checked back in here and saw all these wonderful responses. I have read every one, some several times. I have a lot to consider and learn, but thank you for helping me find some direction. One thing i didn't mention is my role in all this. Im not sone big wig commander with tools at my disposal. Im a newly promoted Sergeant and a squad leader with just a handful of guys under me. The one we just burried was not in my platoon, but i knew him enough to be deeply saddened by his loss. The other three were guys i was close to back in training, but i was not currently stationed with them when it happened. In fact i found out about all three of them on Facebook. This recent one, and the one that called me with suicidal thoughts, have made me want to be much more aware of the mental health of those around me. The scary thing to me is, even with hindsight, i wouldn't have picked these five guys out of the lot as having ANY kind of issues, let alone suicidal tendencies. I have also noticed, maybe because of my nature or leadership style, that im the one people tend come to with problems. I make it known that im here for that purpose, and people take me up on it. So I guess now i want to make sure i can spot when someone needs more help than they may be openly asking for. I will be more vigilant in my assessments of the needs of those under my watch. Thank you all for the detailed and informed replies.

"Trying to repair a lost friendship First time poster here so sorry if I donât explain things very well So a few months ago I went on a trip with my friend and both of our boyfriends. I got a little controlling with the planning of the trip and that caused some tension. And after they went to a party they didnât want us accompanying them to I got upset and distanced myself a little. This lead to her boyfriend and I having an argument. Where he stated if I werenât a girl heâd âbash meâ. After this we havenât spoken but the friend recently contacted my mother to check in on how she was with some local flooding. This has made me think that she still cares for me, and I still greatly care for her. Iâm having trouble approaching how to contact her. And while I know that it was said in anger I feel like I deserve an apology from her boyfriend, or at least reassurance that he wonât ever actually attack me. Is it unreasonable to want an apology from him? Should I let it go? I feel I should also note I do have sever anxiety, thatâs why I struggle with situations like these so much.

"I ruined all four of my friendships in one stupid move Fucking siblings. Every only child thinks they want one. Everyone with a sibling is annoyed by them, but secretly loves them. Not me. My brother makes me want to kill myself. He's one of the two reasons I'm as fucked up as I am today. And he knows that. That's why he does it. Well, one day, he was being nice to me. It was a less depressing time for me. I was bored. Thought, ya know, why not add my brother to the group chat. Big. Fucking. Mistake. He took the pettiness level through the roof and convinced my friends everything I ever do is a fucking lie. He convinced my friends I'm an asshole who does nothing but pick at him and make up problems all day. I have no friends now I feel so betrayed. Alone. I don't really care about that though. I've realized I'll never be happy. Not while he lives. Any chance I have at happiness he can rip away from me just as easily. What the fuck is the point in living???

"A Long Story So hereâs the situation I was and still sort of am in a group of four friends (friends for about 3 years). One of our four was a new girl who we added to the group about half of a year ago. But a few weeks ago three of us pranked the new girlâs best friend, it did not go well and suddenly the NG stopped hanging out with our group (we hangout but mostly play games online). But what I wouldnât learn till the following week was that she wasnât hanging out with me and rest of the group was hanging out her behind my back. They lied about having things to do, or saying the were simply to busy to spend time together. When we did hangout the other two and I they both acted odd and withdrawn, I attempted to dig into why and even asked if it specifically related to NG but I got backlash for doing so so I let up. However later I learned about her not wanting/being to hangout with me was a âinterventionâ where the three of them sat me down and told me that NGâs BF old her that She couldnât be friends with me anymore because her BF told her that it was all my fault and she had to choose between me and her BF in addition I learned that why my friends had been harsh and avoided me earlier in the week, they had lied to me about the whole situation. They knew about the ultimatum that NGâs BF gave her the whole week and decided not to tell me till now, they claim it was to save my feelings but it didnât come off that way. The âInterventionâ ended with her leaving and me leaving as well. The next couple of weeks are bad not only is our group divided, I am the odd man out they spend the bulk of their time with NG and ignore me for the most part. So I confront my two friends (one Iâve been friends with for five years and the other three), I tell them itâs unfair that I am getting the short end of this situation when she made the decision to break up the group, I also tell them that the fact that they were willing to lie and go behind my back is wrong and that they justify it by claiming that NG is the victim because she lost a friend (so did I). They have apologized for the lying and going behind my back but I told them that I donât feel comfortable with them spending time with her and being friends with all the problems she caused me and their easy willingness to lie for her to me. They tell that they will always be friends with her and that I canât ask them to cut her off because it would divide the group, even though she already divided the group by pushing me out and they did nothing about it as a matter of fact the backed her up and supported her decision. So I told them that I have too walk away from the group then because I donât feel valued, respected, or able to trust them after what they have done. Am I in the wrong? What should I do should I walk away? I donât want to throw away my two closest friends but I feel like they donât even care about me anymore. I apologize for the long post.

"My stepmom wont let me back in my old home, mixed feelings. My wife is pregnant with our second child and she didnât want to keep it at first because raising one is tough but two sounds impossible. With rent + daycare + my wife stop working for a year was going to be a squeeze. I reassured her my dad is retired they have a live in house keeper/cook, 5 bedroom house. That we can move back in and help him with sone rent. My sister just gotten a job as a doctor and shes out. The house is empty aside from my half brother whos in high school. My dad said yes of course but the following month my dad said my stepmom wasnât feeling it. She want space and doesnât really want to be around kids that often. My dad offered money but it was about help. I thought it was a win win. My dad was complaining earlier how he was bored and he is working part time since ss and pension wasnât enough. I was going to pay rent. And I thought grandparents like kids. I wasnât expecting them to raise them. I can understand my stepmom side but i cant help but feel if my mom was still around this wouldnât have been an issue. My dad doesnât care but he has to look out for his wife. My wife is stressed out and upset at me for acting like they would help us. I been saving to buy a house for awhile i guess i will have to dig into those. And its a reality check for me your 33 years old and your parents cant always get your back. My father has helped me alot i am always thankful. But my stepmom and I always butting heads.

"Anyone else feel they are unloveable? TLDR: I feel I have no friends and anybody I get close to leaves I started noticing I was always unhappy and sad in my last year of high school. I didnât understand the point of life anymore and everyday driving to school I just thought how easy it was to drive off a cliff on the way to school. I got scared and told my parents who helped me get professional help. I confided in my 3 best friends at the time and almost immediately I noticed 2 of them stopped talking to me. The third Iâm still friends with but not nearly as close as I used to be. When I went to college, my roommate and I became best friends but a year later, he decided to drop out and leave. I realize this is through no fault of my own but it still sucks losing a best friend. Finally, my 3rd year of college, I met the most amazing woman. With her help, I felt like I finally defeated depression. We dated for 2 years and I was so sure we were gonna last. However, I got a job on the east coast whereas we were both from the west coast. We decided we could last through the distance so I took the job and moved 3000 miles away. She just told me it wasnât working out and broke up with me. She was my best friend and my girlfriend for 2 years. I never felt a connection with anyone else as strong as I did for her. Now Iâm fearing my depression may have come back. Iâm thinking I didnât defeat depression but instead had her to use as a support. Iâm here on the east coast of the US and I have no friends or family around me. I donât know what to do and everyday I just feel like itâs me vs the whole world. Iâve already lost all hope and I feel like I donât deserve happiness. Why else would happiness be ripped from me every time I feel like I found it. Sorry for the long post I just didnât know where else to turn to

"I miss my best friend and they miss me I'm 12 and my best friend is 11. We both have the same birthday and were best friends last year. So this year I chose to homeschool for something. And during this year I've barely seen my best friend. I would ask my mom a lot to setup some weekly hang-out with him but it never got to happen.During this time we've found a soccer team to play on together. One practice, we got to talk after. During this chat he mentioned him always asking his mom to let me come to his house. I stated I did the same thing. That night it made me glad he wanted to hang out with me all the time. About 5 days later I realized what this chat meant. Really when he stated that he asked his mom about me coming over a lot, he was practically saying he missed me. And when I stated the same thing back I was saying the same thing. I learned it was a test of friendship from him, and that we were both thinking the same thing, missing eachother a lot. Right now, we're both just waiting for a weekly hang-out to happen. During this wait, we're both sad; what's the best thing for me to do when we're waiting? Should I try and talk to him more? (he doesn't have any way of texting me at the time)

I have a few friends but the more my life has gone on, the more Iâve realized certain dislikings i have towards them. I want to meet new people and do new things, something that my friends arenât interested in or donât have time for. Iâm as bad as you could imagine when it comes to making new friends because I can be really socially awkward and Iâm convinced that few other people share specific interests that I would look for in friends or a girlfriend. I have few (if any) aspirations in life and I just feel like Iâm drifting through life without any idea what I want. I donât feel like Iâve accomplished much in my life, Iâm in college but Iâve never held a job before and Iâm hardly passionate enough about a career to really be interested to want to pursue it.

Long story short, she stopped talking to me and then I stopped talking to her but she thought I was the one who stopped talking to her and so we ignored eachother for three years even though we go to the same school. Recently, I texted her saying that I apologize. She said that she'd give me a second chance, so I start texting her questions to get to know her again, but she takes hours to answer and when she does answer, all she says is ""Yes/no, you?"" When I ask her a question and ""Haha ok"" when I answer my own question. She even leaves me on read sometimes. Should I stop texting her? I really don't understand why she decided to give me a second chance if she won't even try to support the conversation. Just saying ""Sorry, I don't wanna talk to you anymore"" would've been a lot less painful.

"Help...Relationship with my depressed, mentally messed up friend This is my first time posting on reddit, sorry if I have made any mistakes. This post is gonna be quite long. To start with, my friend and I are both 15 year olds living in Hong Kong and we study in the same school. She is a great person, very special, someone I can never forget. The problem is that she is the kind of person who smiles in front of people but is actually depressed. And I feel like I will just make things worse. Because of her laughs and near-crazy actions, nobody knows her true feelings. In fact she constantly complains about everything, being unpopular, being immature, the education system here, her online friends, just to mention a few. She is tired and feels like a loser all the time. Games and cosplaying is the only way she escapes from reality. I don't mind listening to rants. It's ok to be sad. But I seriously do not know how to respond when she comes up with questions related to suicide. During lessons my friend would show me long paragraphs about her self hate and ask for my reply. A typical example of our conversation: ""Why am I so unpopular?"" ""..."" ""WHY AM I SO UNPOPULAR."" ""...maybe you have different hobbies and interests from most people?"" Then she starts to regret her choices, why did she choose to study in this school, if she had been in another school, she would have been happier... etc. In her letters, she questioned about the meaning of life. She wrote about ""nightmares"", ""thought crimes"" and ""leaving the endless circle of life"". That left me terrified. All I could do is to sit next to her speechless. If I said something wrong she would just jump off from the roof. Not to mention all those confusing philosophical questions. I can never give an answer simply because I don't know how. I once asked the school social workers how to talk to a depressed friend. Her advice was literally trash, and I ended up crying when I talked about her suicidal thoughts. I have no idea what to do. The next day when you see her at the school gates, she puts on that smile again, but she definitely has problems. Anyone has experience in dealing with such friends? Depressed friends who smiles all the time? It sounds weird to ask what I can do for you, because she normally won't respond (at least I think so). What should I (or should not) say to her?

Everyone else with us started ganging up on me saying stuff like âThis is why nobody likes youâ and then my other friend comes over and tells them to keep me in the room (Theater stuff). Now everyone seems fine with me but it really upset me and I donât know what I can do to change it. They said I ask the wrong questions and I feel like I just want to be included. Iâm sorry if this isnât the right subreddit or if Iâm caught in the moment but Iâve had a day to think and it still is bugging me.

"college- medical withdrawal for a semester Okay, so I'm thinking about either doing a course load reduction or a medical withdrawal due to my anxiety and depression. I've already contacted my academic advisor and the financial aid office, but I honestly have no idea whether everything will work out or not. If I manage to get a course load reduction, does anyone have any ideas for things I can do to help myself get better during this semester? If it ends up not working out, does anyone know about other ways I can go about making this semester less stressful? For background, I have a scholarship for tuition for the next two years and I'm terrified as fuck that I'll lose that if I get a course load reduction. Also, my parents basically don't know what mental health is so there's no way I can talk to them about it.

"[Need Advice] Need anti depressants but I don't want my mum to know about it. Hello guys, I am 17 and I live in Singapore with my Mum. I have been depressed on and off for the past 5 years with serious suicidal thoughts for the last 4. I really think that it's time that I start anti depressants because I reckon it would help me tons. The problem is, I don't want my mum to know because the last time I opened up about being slightly suicidal and very depressed, she freaked out on me (don't need to get into details.) She has had a history with it herself and I know that if i ever took my life, it would permanently ruin her. At this point, medication is my last resort. I've had a girlfriend and it made no difference whatsoever, I still feel empty most of the time and would rather die than anything else. I know that in Singapore you're able to consent medically when you're 16, but I'm not sure if i can possible get around her for meds like this without her knowledge/consent. Any help for my situation would be fantastic :) Thanks everyone

"Girl friend pregnant (lgbt) I m a girl My girlfriend is pregnant with a male friend we used as a sperm donor. She did this 1 month after starting dating me but I stayed with her because i like her and I do like kids but now I have no feelings about this. She keeps saying I m not happy to have a baby but I m not having a baby, her and her friend are so no I m not happy, but I m not not happy. When the baby is born of course i will love and treat it like it s mine. But am I wrong for not being excited saying I m having a baby when in reality I m just the step parent.

"I can't fucking handle this life How do people do it? I'm supposed to be happy, because I live in Norway, one of the best places to live. How the fuck can I? The thought of all those innocent people murdered just so that the westerners can live comfortably, it just makes me sick. There's no logic to any of this, I'm born into an uncaring and cold world, forced to work my ass of 9-5 every day, just so some corporate asshole can get more money. I earn a fraction of that amount, and then I have to pay some of that to the government. The government then tries to keep me ""safe"", by threatening me with involuntary commitment. They're just trying to keep their livestock in check. We're all just slaves, and no one else seems to understand that. There's this weight on my shoulders, this expectation for me to be something. I can't fucking understand how everyone is okay with this. I want out.

"My Friend is Draining Me Apologies, this is a very long post! Iâve been good friends with a girl for around 10 years since we were teenagers. She moved overseas around 5 years ago. She used to be such a fun, bubbly and funny person until she met her boyfriend around 3 years ago. Looking back, I can see that she was a always bit crazy and insecure (her father is emotionally abusive and tells her sheâs worthless and stupid), but meeting him seems to have exacerbated all her bad qualities. She has a really low self esteem and perception issues when it comes to relationships. She also has OCD. She was, and still is OBSESSED with her now ex boyfriend. They had an on off relationship where she thought it was normal to call him âjust ten timesâ in one day, and would get upset and not be able âsleep or eatâ if he doesnât reply, thinks talking on the phone three times a day is not much, they pushed and shoved each other, she hit him, he talked to other girls and acted like she wasnât his girlfriend, sheâd call his voicemail just to hear his voice, he threatened to hurt her, she considered going to a shitty college just to be near him, etc.. basically an abusive and obsessive relationship with awful communication. Every time she messages me, sheâll ask how I am and ask a few questions, and then steer the conversation back to her numerous problems and her ex. About how sheâs so poor (goes out every second night and goes on shopping sprees), how sheâs really sad (but wonât see a counselor because sheâs âtoo poorâ), how she wants to be confident and independent (goes back to the ex repeatedly and doesnât listen to any of the advice I give her), tells me she canât eat or sleep because sheâs heartbroken (I told her I was eventually okay after I broke up with an ex, but she brushed it off as I hadnât gone out with him for as long and how she gave everything to her ex). She also says how Iâm so lucky to live with my boyfriend and how I have such an amazing life, as if sheâs the only person in the world that has problems. Iâve talked to her multiple times about how talking about her ex all the time and her problems is effecting me (as well as her other friends), and how she should really see a professional as this behavior is really hurting her. She always apologizes and says that she didnât realize how it might make me annoyed, and sheâll send me an inspirational video or inspirational words, and asking about me before going back to changing the topic so she can talk about herself, her ex and how itâs so hard for her right now, how she feels suffocated and her heart is broken. I understand that people go through hard times in their lives, but this has lasted at least 3 years. Iâve always said how Iâll be there for her and that if she needs to talk to someone, Iâll listen, but Iâm starting to feel that this is a one way relationship. The frustrating thing is that she says she agrees to everything I say, and howâs shes going to change, but nothing has changed! She says sheâs more confident and doing this and that to help herself, but she just plasters selfies and videos of herself going out with people to try and convince people that sheâs having an amazing time. I donât want to just ignore her, but I donât think talking to her again will do anything. Iâve been nice, brutally honest, and even angry at her and nothing has changed. Sheâs stuck in her own tragic world and Iâm realizing that maybe she thrives in this drama, and that sheâs lonely and needs a boyfriendâs attention to validate her self worth . Our other mutual friend has cut ties with her due to this. I think I have put up with this for so long as weâre not living in the same country.. Sorry about the long rant and formatting, Iâm on my cellphone. TL;DR friend who lives overseas is emotionally draining me every time I talk to her. I have already talked to her about it multiple times, but she always goes back to her old ways.

"I canât decided if Iâve been managing or avoiding my mind and feelings... How is everyone today? For the past two months, I havenât had a depressive/anxiety episode even though the problems are in the back of my head everyday I wake up. It triggers my anxiety a little because Iâm anticipating another one of my relapses. Itâs been weeks since Iâve cried or have been stuck in bed (which is good compared to what Iâm like usually). But I still donât feel too inclined to reach out to other people or hang out with them. I donât feel like dealing with peopleâs criticisms or judgements of me. Iâm just not open to it still...other than that I just feel indifferent/âMehâ. But is that a good thing? Or should I zip my lips and stop thinking about it :/ some perspective would be nice.

"Not invited to my friend's wedding. Is it time to abandon ship? A guy I have been close friends with for the last 13 years is getting married this year and I've come to the realisation that I'm not invited to the wedding. To be honest, we are not as close as we used to be. We used to hang out all time, but as lives became busy, we spent less time together. I still attend almost all of his social gatherings, though that is probably only 3 to 4 times a year. The weird thing is, I was invited to his engagement party. I got him and his partner a really meaningful gift that they still comment on whenever they see me, yet they didn't invite me the wedding. When I was slightly intoxicated at another friend's girls night some time ago, I asked the bride if invites had been sent out yet because I couldn't remember receiving mine. We then began the awkward exchange in which she told me it was really hard to narrow down the guest list and I realised I was never getting my invite. I tried to act as if I wasn't offended and that I understood, but honestly, I'm really hurt. I've been invited to the hen's night which is in a month. It is not a cheap night. Upwards of $200 for accommodation, games etc. It feels rude to expect me to pay so much to attend a hen's night when they wouldn't even pay for me to be a guest at their wedding. But I also realise that if I don't go to the hen's, it could come across that I don't value the friendship enough to go. What should I do?

"Today, my mother tried to commit suicide. Due to recent family events, it awakened childhood feelings of abandonment, inadequacy, and loneliness in my mom. She felt alone. Luckily, she was too coward to utilize her personal firearm. She chose to drink herself into an oblivion and inhale exhaust fumes. The exhaust fumes made her tired, and in her tired stupor, she thought she could sit outside and freeze to death. She had a bottle of heart pressure medication as a backup. I thank my lucky stars that she fell asleep in the grass instead. Her attempt was unsuccessful. Originally I blamed myself for having been hard on her. I have always been honest with my mother, and she has always kept a strong face. But today I learned how fragile she truly is. I take it upon myself to protect her, and support her, no matter what. She raised me and continues to raise my younger siblings. Itâs time that we give back. I have been thankful that I have not suffered the loss of someone I love to suicide. I thought that I would see the signs if it were going to happen. I didnât. I will be more aware and I will show my love for people I care about. I often think about the ones I love but donât take the time to reach out. That changes today. I refuse to hold back my love for fear of being hurt and pushed away, for the people I love are not hearing it enough but still stay. I am grateful for the second chance with my mother. I have thought often about missing her someday when she dies. I never thought that it might come so soon. I am renewed and reborn. My goals and ambitions stronger than ever. My love for my family renewed in the wake of our war. My mother the warrior on the front lines, taking the shots from sibling to sibling and softening the blow so we all can continue the crusade. This will change. Today I choose to love.

"I've never talked about this to anyone I've struggled with depression since I was in 2nd grade. For the last 7 years it's gotten worst, I'm 20 at the moment. When I was 13 I was raped occasionally. Being raped when it first happen didn't bother me as much because I didnt understand what was happening until years later. What did bother me at the time was that I felt alone. I've always felt alone, never felt like anyone cared for me or about me. I fought with my mom and step dad a lot which made me feel even more lonely. I never talked about feeling lonely to anyone because I was always embarrassed about it and still do. Because me and my parents had a rocky relationship I would be abused by both at times. One time I was arguing with my mom and she ended up getting a 2 by 4 and started hitting me with it. I never rasied my hands at my parents, just talked a lot of shit and was an asshole to them. My parents kicked me out of their house when I was 14. I ended up living with my grandpa. This made me feel unwanted and even more lonely now that my parents gave up on me. I lived with my grandpa for about 9 months before he sent me back to my parents because he couldn't ""afford"" to keep me. I wasn't an asshole to my grandpa nor was I mean to him, I just was a teen who stayed up late and took long showers. My grandpa giving up on me was heartbreaking for me. I felt like no one wanted me and if I ended everything then everything would be better. I didn't even last a week at my parents house, they shipped me off to live with some family who lived in the rural country area instead of the city. I lived there for maybe 4 months and finished my freshmen year of high school there. I didn't feel welcomed anywhere I went and for the most part I felt more beyond alone. Majority of the time at my uncle's I was in my room, alone and desperate for a friend. After 4 lonely months of really being alone I was given back to my parents again. After coming home broken I learned to keep to myself. No one wanted me and no one cared. When I got back home I was sent to an all boy high school. Once again I had to go to a new school and try to fit in somehow. I was lonely for a while until I met this girl. I'm afraid to write her name incase she ever reads this and it hurts reading/writing it but I need to get this off my chest. I met this beautiful girl named Cindy at a school function. She went to the all girl school down a couple streets. Both all gender schools would make events for each other to get students that social interaction. Anyways I meet this beautiful girl named Cindy, she was nice to me and I was nice to her. We dated for over a year and while it lasted it was nice. The way she broke up with me literally broke me. I was having a really sad day and told her about how I struggle with really bad depression and that I have suicidal thoughts. Her response was ""oh"" and she slowly stopped talking to me. Eventually she stopped talking to me and when she did talk to me she made excuses about not having time to talk to me. She was my only friend, the only person I was close to. She couldn't be there for me when I needed her most, when I needed a friend most. So I stayed alone thinking maybe school was too much for her at the moment. Then one day I get on Facebook only to see her on it, I clicked on her page and saw that she had been on hanging out with friends and having the time of her life. She slowly broke me, I couldn't handle it and called her to confront her about it. She made excuses and talked about how she didnt have time for me at the moment, so she hung up and left it alone. I was reaching my breaking point, I was going to commit suicide. I sent her a text message talking about how I needed her to talk to me and be a friend because I was getting worst. She never responded to me however she did get in contact with my school to let them know what I was dealing with. I was so embarrassed that she did this to me, I felt betrayed and hurt that she made me the schools problem instead of hers. It hurt ne so bad. I was embarrassed that the school knew, I was embarrassed that my parents knew now. I wanted to kill myself more than ever now. I was so hurt by this and was angry at Cindy. I went home and tried stabbing myself. My mom went in my room to talk to me, just so happened at that moment I had a kitchen knife in my hand to stab myself. My mon fought me over it and sent me to a psychiatric hospital. I stayed there until December 23rd. At the hospital I tried killing myself twice. First time was when the guards/residents give you cracks, I ate the crackers but stuffed the wrapper down my throat. One if the residents heard me making choking nosies and came in to save me. Second time was when I started swallowing my food instead of chewing on it to choke me out again. They put me on these medications that didn't help but I acted like they did so I can go home. I was

"Is it stress, depression or burn out? Hey, Iâm a diabetic 1 with Autism. For the past 3 years i have felt constant fatigue, no motivation, sleep issues, stomach problems, bad memory and concentration issues. I took antidepressants Cymbalta 60 mg before this during 8 months for major stress and it helped me with almost no side effects. But after i quit antidepressants Cymbalta 60 mg ,the fatigue, no motivation, sleep issues, stomach problems and concentration issues has been persistent in my life. Now for 3 years. No matter how much rest i get i feel tired. Even if excercise, eat healthy, do yoga and meditation. My blood sugar levels has been up and down lately. But even if they are controlled i feel the same. A cause could be that i have worked on a lot of projects during the past 3 years. It went as far as that i started to get suicide thoughts. I do not feel any ups or downs in my life. Things i used to like to do isles enjoyable. I rather stay at home than being social. I believe i have major depression and i have visited psychologist and psychiatrist who have advised me to take antidepressants. But the question is if Iâm stressed, have major depression or simply burnt out. I certainly feel that i have a huge major depression. My OCD thought are back and i have been stuck on testing my blood sugar 10-15 times per day during the past year. Which also could bring my stress levels up. The past year has been very stressful for me work wise. But even if i get a weekend of rest i donât feel rested. I have been to different psychiatrists and psychologist and the conclusion is either major depression or burn out. I barely have the energy to clean my apartment anymore, wash my clothes or think about my hygiene. I feel tearful occasionally on some days. I have thought about taking antidepressants again, particularly Cymbalta since it worked for me the first time. But i have been afraid of taking them. Instead my psychiatrist described me brintellix (Vortioxetine), 10 mg per day for my depression. But the question is, iâm i stressed, depressed or burnt out? Anyone have been in a similar case? Any experiences of the antidepressants brintellix (Vortioxetine) for major depression? Iâm so afraid of starting to take them, but i donât want to feel this way of every morning waking up with no motivation for anything that the day brings me.

"Am I crazy for wanting to get back with her? So let me give you guys a bit of a timeline first: - April 2017 we met at work, became really good friends. She still had a boyfriend, but broke up with him about 2 weeks after we started hanging out. - June 2017 I told her I liked her as more than a friend, she didn't feel this way towards me at the time. - July 2017 she started dating a guy she already knew, we'll call him Jake. - August 2017 she broke up with Jake. Jake made her feel terrible for it and cut her off completely, leaving her to say that she hated him and wanted no part of him. - September/October 2017 she told me she's always been attracted to me, but wasn't ready for a relationship. I was in love with her at this time, after knowing her for a while and her being everything I want in someone. Suggested being FWB, which I took her up on. But whenever I tried to make a move on it, she didn't seem to want to do anything. We hung out just us 2 every day, would always be talking, but for some reason when the time came around to make a move she never seemed to want to do anything. Mid October 2017 she said how we would be better off being friends since we didn't seem to be going anywhere and that it was hurting her self esteem, and that she started talking to Jake again. She is currently still dating Jake, but from what I hear from her are on the verge of another breakup. And now I want her more than ever. I was absolutely heartbroken when she cut things off with me, and I'm still not over her. And she knows this. If she cuts things off with Jake, I don't know what to do. I want her back more than anything, but at the same time it's like she put me through such pain and I don't want to chance that happening again. She is everything that I could possibly want in a girl, and I can't imagine myself without her. And we're still friends, which probably isn't helping to be honest. But she's still my best friend. Am I crazy for feeling this way?

"Severe Ibs and depression combo is a death sentence Hi I posted a few times on this forum last year April sometine due to my depression and I'm posting again because well, it's back. So I'm just going to write a few things about myself and why I'm posting here. Im a 20 year old guy from London, England and I've been depressed for about 2 years now. I was also diagnosed with IBS about 7 or so years ago. I was at university for digital media and I finished. My first year but when the second year started my IBS symptoms got worse and I was I physically unable to go. thankfully the university gave me a year off and said I can start my second year next year after I get better. However it just seems to be getting worse not better. I can barely go outside without going through severe anxiety attacks which leads to horrible pains in my stomach for which I need to go home to go toilet for, when it was really bad I would feel very faint and start having panic attacks. It reached the point where I was practically housebound. I spent like 3 months playing games, watching anime and TV shows and the pains started to get a bit better. Then 2 days ago I went toilet and it happened again, severe pain, feeling very uneasy and then boom out of nowhere crippling depression, the waves just hit me. I began feeling hopeless again, I felt unsatisfied with life. Not just my life, but life in general. Thanks to my love of Anime, Webnovels, Games and Movies I started to wish my life was like that. I know it's childish, but deep down it's just how I felt. I couldn't accept reality, it was too mundane for me and I wasn't satisfied just sitting there everyday just watching or reading things. But I couldn't do anything about it because everytime I try to do something my IBS kicks in and basically cripples me. And I know that even if I try and do something, it's not really what I want. I don't want my life to be normal. All I would really be doing is trying to avoid the pain that it will never happen. I know this is long and it might be hard to emphasize with me if you don't really understand it. But I just felt like I really wanted to say something and see if maybe there were other people like me. I guess you could say I'm looking for friends who can understand me, I'm hoping that maybe it will make living a little easier if I have people to talk about the things I love with who also understand what it's like going through depression.

"Best friend is dating someone who is not right for them Hi! So my best (guy) friend is dating this girl who really doesn't treat him well and we have talked about it and he himself has said he's not very happy with her but then goes right back to her?

"Need to talk and I have nobody. Hey all. Just need to talk, really struggling right now and trying to dig out of it. Not really sure what else to do. Pattern of behaviour: Wake up in the morning with immediate feelings of depression and loneliness. Acute feelings of being alone in bed, uncomfortable. Become compelled to flip through Bumble, Tinder because I feel a need to try and immediately correct the problem. I never (and I mean never) match. Have to fight urges to immediately abuse addictions like porn and weed. Sometimes do, sometimes donât. Prepare for work, fight off feelings of sadness about ex-girlfriend and situation it puts me in. Fight the urge to blame her for the failure of the relationship even though I logically know Iâm wrong or thatâs not fair. She just left to pursue school and had to move on, she didnât do anything to me. Fight feelings of rejection and feelings of inadequacy in my value to others even though thereâs no reason to feel that here. Walk to work, continue to fight with anger issues re: relationships and validation. Sometimes frustration stems from lack of work success but more often than not itâs physical appearance issues and relationship issues. I get caught in a loop being mad at her and being mad at myself and my capacity to deal with being alone. Auto-pilot at work. Able to do job easily, so lack of focus is a non-issue. I spend too much time on Facebook and other social media looking for outlets to expand my social network and friends. Find it very difficult to do so without appearing over-anxious or creepy and new opportunities rarely prevent themselves. Sometimes Imarket business and contact clients/potential clients. Sometimes a boost comes from having success here, but often the lack thereof is equally esteem damaging. Go home, usually bus. Already tired. Immediately engage addictions, usually beer and weed. Start watching TV or playing games and rarely stop until bed time. I'll leave easy tasks like cleaning dishes, etc for weeks. Continual evasion of solving problems, instead opting to rely on substances to either forget or balance my feelings of sadness. Occasionally I have friends over, but many of them use substances as well or are in similar life situations so finding solace in these encounters is limited. Furthermore, they are my friends of many years and represent a kind of social stagnation. At night Iâm usually in bed by 10, not because Iâm out of things to do, but because Iâm either drunk or bored. On weekends Iâm lucky if I do anything outside of what I do immediately after work. I rarely feel compelled to do anything. If I get invited to a bar, I end up going and feeling alienated from everyone and âout-of-placeâ. Most of the time, I just feel too tired to join my friends, but I also feel a lack of motivation because Iâm sure itâll just be the same crowdâand it appears their lives keep moving while mine does not. I am behind on adulthood. I have only recently acquired a driverâs license, I just renewed my glasses prescription and only just started living on my own. I have to get my teeth taken care of and they are a source of stress and physical pain (still have wisdom teeth at 34). I have the habits of a teenager. I smoke copious amounts of weed, I drink daily and I donât pursue my interests or goals. I know the right course of action most of the time, but I actively ignore it because the amount required to get healthy is just too much. I have spent a great majority of my life single and most of my relationships aside from a few gems have been tumultuous, emotional rollercoasters. More often than not, Despite all these things I feel undervalued in my society. I think of myself as smart, funny and confident in my skills, but I feel that the rest of the world doesnât care and doesnât see those as appealing. I feel like without looks and an academic education, you can only accomplish so much and that peopleâs standards are so high that competition for a good role in society is unlikely. I feel unable to compete when the above issues prevent me from succeeding. Motivation to do anything is lowered by the lack of acceptance in general, the feeling that I should be acceptable the way I am but am not, and my inability to seem to control that situation. It doesnât help that on the face of it, most people will tell me that I seem like a âcatchâ, an incredibly high-value person with lots to offerâexcept that none of that seems to translate to my life, emotional attachments or stability. I'm just lost.

"Should family be more than this? Iâm 24 and no kids and my family is just like everyone elseâs around me; broken. My dad is sometimey and has kept few promises he has made to me. In the end itâs not him being bad thatâs the problem, itâs that he says the problem is ME. Like with men I have talked to in the past, they can only say what IâM doing wrong not listening to me and claiming I am crazy. This behavior with my father led me to cutting off all contact late last year. My family, his side, otherwise see nothing wrong with his behavior. The issue is ME. Iâm expecting too much from him.....like if he says heâs coming to our city (he lives 30 mins away) and I get upset when he doesnât show and heâs done it just about every time. Or even when he claims heâs coming to get the dog he left with my uncle (left him there a year ago claiming it would only be for two weeks) he just lies constantly. I was raised around my family growing up. I didnât see my father but I saw his side of the family, cousins, aunts and uncles. They may have lived states away but we always spent summers and holidays together. At this point my family on either side rarely see each other. We have family reunions that none of my cousins attend, all too busy now that their grown. At the end of the day I was told this; Iâm an adult and my father has nothing to do with the things Iâve done in life, or nothing to do with the guys I used to talk to that led to constant rejection and overall cynical view on love (getting sperm donor at 28.) I should be grateful for times spent with him, five minutes should be the best in the world (heâs so self absorbed Iâm only worth five minutes every few months) I have no right as a child to threaten him if he wont leave me alone for good. I donât see why I have to live like this, I suffer from depression and constantly beatbox myself up over every mistake I make. Iâm unhappy, Iâve been getting better since getting rid od him and focusing on the family that actually has time time for me. A family shouldnât just be there for emergency. A family is thinking of others before themselves, loving one another enough to know them. Am I really expecting or demanding too much? Am I just mad because yet another man wonât do what I want?

"A friend cut me off So recently a friend of mine cut me off and Iâm not really sure why. I guess to understand my concern it would be best to get the whole story. I had first met her earlier this school year. Our desks were right next to each other in math class. Back then, she was very talkative, sociable, optimistic, and energetic around me. Iâm not always the most talkative type but that didnât seem to bother her at all. She always shouted for my attention to say hi to me when passed each other in the halls. She asked for my number, introduced me to a few of her friends, and even invited me over to her house for lunch during one of our off periods. We texted a couple times though I will admit each time I kept feeling like I was annoying her. Eventually, she had invited me to come with her boyfriend and group of friends to hang out at the mall over Christmas vacation. I was so excited. However, when the day finally came, I couldnât help but feel like a third wheel. She was much more focused on her boyfriend than she was on anyone else and the only time she noticed me was when I had wandered off without telling any of them. That wasnât cool of me, I admit, but I just didnât feel needed or even wanted there at times. Later that night though, I texted her and apologized for not being that social but she it was all fine. But I still couldnât shake the feeling that she was upset with me. When we came back from vacation, my suspicions grew. She was a lot more quiet and distant from me and was usually on her phone with her headphones in whenever I was around. It was around this time that I started to become a lot more needy. She still responded to my texts and told me that the reason she was so quiet was because she had a headache. But I couldnât help but notice that she was still pretty social around her other friends. At one point when we were walking in the halls, she had her headphones in and didnât say a word to me but the minute she saw one of her other friends, she took her headphones out and screamed for his attention. All while I was standing right next to her. It was a week before winter vacation when we got into an argument. You see, she was aware of my depression and offered her assistance in helping me deal with it. However, in our argument, she expressed her displeasure with how she felt she was putting in all the effort into dealing with my problems. I tried apologizing to her, probably getting a bit too dramatic about it, but she just expressed her annoyance at how I constantly needed her assurance and that if I donât try to change myself, she wonât be my friend anymore. Eventually, I apologized for my part in the argument and how I didnât make her help feel appreciated, but I also explained to her that I was doing something about my depression. I see a psychiatrist and take antidepressants every night. Still, she insisted that I needed to change. But by this point, whenever I spoke to her in person, she always seemed disinterested and kind of annoyed. When I asked her if she had a problem with me, she would always say that she was either busy or wasnât in the mood for it. Eventually, she responded that she needed space for the whole vacation, so I didnât text her at all. But when the vacation was over, I tried to text if everything was fine now only to discover that she had blocked my number. Now, she doesnât even acknowledge my presence anymore and almost seems to actively avoid me. I apologize if this is really long. I just wanted to be as detailed as possible. At this point, I just feel at a loss and confused about what happened. Iâm not sure if I did something wrong or if she was ever my friend at all. I mean, our friendship felt genuine those first months before Christmas. But now I just donât know what to think or do.

"What's the deal with my husband's future best friends wife? Hi everyone, I am having a problem and I'm not sure what to do about it. I am led to believe that my future husband's (married next month) best friend's wife dislikes me, but I'm getting mixed signals. I have always (I thought) been nice to her. When we hang out as couples, everything is fine and we get along great. We have a similar education level and both come from a science background, so it's easy for us to talk. We have spent hours hanging out in these situations. We even all took a road trip together this past summer a few states away to attend a very lovely (albeit very strange) wedding of another of their mutual friends, and we went out to dinner and shopping while the boys were at the bachelor party. It seems like whenever I try to plan anything though, she isn't available, even if her husband is. I planned a surprise party for my fiances 30th birthday that I had been talking about for months--her husband was there, and at the last minute, she couldn't attend. He didn't even tell me she wasn't coming until he showed up without her. We visited their home on 4th of July weekend and there invited them to my parents house (they have a pool) for the holiday. He showed up, she didn't because she was ""sick"" (read: hungover.) Her husband showed up for an hour or so and she was continually calling him asking when he was going to come home and take care of her. The thing that makes me think this isnt a string of coincidences is my bridal shower. It is tomorrow, and I have found out she will not be attending. She Rsvpd to my mom with just a generic ""I can't make it, we're busy"" but then a few days later, her husband messaged my fiance asking if he wanted to hang out on the day of my shower. I have always been nice to her, and I'm not sure whats going on. Anyone in Reddit land have any advice? Her husband and my future husband have been best friends since high school and this is bugging both of us.

"Worried about my daughter I am in such a shit situation I don't know what to do. Myself and ex partner both have a child who is nearly 8 years old. We have been separated for a number of years and i see my daughter at weekends. The mother of my daughter isn't a bad person, she had a lot of bad stuff to deal with when she was younger. She basically smokes weed to shut out all the bad stuff and usually only does this when our daughter is in bed. A lot of the time she has threatened to kill herself and this has happened in front of my daughter I'm sure which is so wrong. Today when I went round she started getting angry and I heard my daughter say to her 'if you don't stop I will run in front of a car when I'm older'. This has broke my heart completely and I don't know what to do. I hope my daughter doesn't mean this and is just copying her mum, but this is only gonna get worse as she gets older. Just to be clear her mum is a good person she just has issues and goes off the rails sometimes but I know for sure she loves her so much. I was just looking for advice on what I can do to make this better. Thanks

"Falling for someone you have no chance to be with Warning: Super long read Have you ever fallen for someone that you know you have absolutely no chance with? Itâs been 4 years since Iâve fallen for a girl back in college, which ended up in heartbreak and depression because she already found someone else. Iâve lost all motivations and my passion for arts (Iâm an art student), failed my thesis which sent me into another dark place, âfriendsâ were not even there to help me get up, and for the remaining years I had in college, the thing that kept me going are my parents, I just wanted to survive for them. Iâve lost all emotions, the flame that was once burning in my heart, the excitement I had when I was a freshman. I graduated college 7 months ago and found work not related to the course I took up, it felt really low, but I just wanted to survive. Training for work now, didnât want to make friends again, had one, but he didnât liked the people so he left in a few weeks, the only thing in my mind was to focus and be better for this job to survive. Avoided lunch and hanging out with workmates, and didnât really reveal much about myself aside from having a mundane life. The trainers were aware of my introversion and decided to have random sitting arrangements every week so we could get to know our workmates more, and I could get to talk about other stuff aside from work. 3 weeks in training and still, I didnât made any connections, I only help out my workmates professionally, point out mistakes and the next step they should take. I get to be sit mates with the liveliest girl in training, playful and have a contagious âhappyâ aura(?). There were also a few talks and laughs about work related stuff, but I didnât really made efforts to start it, she was always the one that engages first (and thatâs because sheâs an extrovert and does this to everyone anyways). Being around her, hearing her voice, seeing her smile felt something, it felt like the flame that I lost 4 years ago came back. But, what made me fell the most is that sheâs intelligent as well and speaks in English flawlessly (I live in a country outside US). I can also relate to her because she suffers from clinical depression and requires therapy sessions every now and then (everyone in training knows this anyways because she told the class from the get-go). I didnât really asked her out for lunch or coffee, I really wanted to so I could get to know her better and be friends with her, be her guide in her darkest days, but my introversion and over thinking always gets the best of me. There were only a few times she joined me and my friend during a coffee break where I found out a few things about her. There were times that I see the sadness beyond her smile, and times where her depression was clearly visible and affected me greatly. I always think about scenarios - if the conditions were right - where I get to talk with her and lend a helping hand, at the end of the day they only remain as thoughts. I know she doesnât think about me like how I think about her. Every time our shift ends, I leave the office quickly and ignore the feelings I have for her, my mind is at a constant battle on whether or not to ask her for lunch, ask her if sheâs ok. Itâs even worse at night, whenever I see her late night tweets about her depression, a part of me just wants to be there for her, and the other part gives me the realization of how pathetic I am and that I donât deserve her. I know that she had an ex-bf that broke her heart, and currently has a gf (sheâs bi). Yet, she still gives me inspiration in every photo I take. I really donât know what is wrong with me, Iâm being tormented by my own mind and I still like it. Knowing that she already has someone in her heart, yet still seeing her depressed at times (and looking at her tweets), really makes me want to step up and do something, but held back by my own tormented soul. Next week would be the last week in training, after that weâre going to get split up into teams and do actual work, but still go back to class to share our experience and reflect upon them. One could only hope for a miracle that I gain the strength and courage to talk to her more and be a part of her life. I really hate this feeling, yet this pain fuels my passion even more.

"the beautiful things in life Light streaming through the leaves of a tree. The night sky, thousands of pinpricks in black velvet. Someone so beautiful they make you catch your breath when you look at them. Those songs that make the hairs stand on your arms. The only thing that keeps me alive is the beauty in the world. It makes time slow down just for a little, and stops the incessant flow of (mostly negative) thoughts. There's so much beauty left to see. It can be as amazing as the the clear blue waters surrounding a tropical island. It could be as mundane as a flock of birds flying in harmony over your roof. Sure, there are a lot of really shitty things that we go through, but there are those breathtaking moments you have yet to experience. Those moments where you think ""damn, it really is nice to be alive.""

"I'm a daca recipient and I fucking hate it. I was born in Mexico and brought to the US when I was 3. This of course means I'm one of those ""nasty illegals"" everyone seems to hate. My goal has always been success. Ever since I was a kid I daydreamed of owning a mansion with fancy gates, a huge lawn, a big pool. This was always my goal. I wasn't going to accept living in poverty like my parents or having an ""average"" life. So I worked hard for it. I was always top of my class, I was on the dean's honor list in college, I started (and failed) my first few businesses, joined clubs, went to a lot of events to meet people, and landed an internship. I was even in the middle of starting my next business. I also got my credit score up to almost 800 and started funding my retirement/investment account. Because my whole life has been focused on success, I attempted suicide a few times when I found out I was illegal and couldn't even go to college in high school. Obviously they all failed. However in 2012, the year before I graduated, Obama passed daca. Because I had been here since I was a toddler, was going to finish school, and didn't have even a single misdemeanor, I was able to get a social security number, a work permit, a driver's license, open investment accounts, and received protection from deportation. Now Trump has ended it. The final decision will be made in early August, but it's most likely going to be rescinded. What am I supposed to do then? Just fucking accept losing everything? Everything I worked towards will have been for nothing. Even if daca continues, am I supposed to just keep living in fear of it ending again forever? I'm losing all my fucking hair stressing over this. I've had a cold for months that hasn't gone away, and everything hurts. I can't even talk to anyone about this. Everyone just tells me to man up and work some shitty job picking fruit in the fields. No one understands that I actually have goals in life. I refuse to accept a life where I work 60 hours a week, breaking down my body, for $30k a year with no room for advancement and living in fear every day. I've never been fond of life in the first place. The only thing that ever gave me happiness was growing my net worth, and pretty soon I won't even be able to do that. Why shouldn't I end it all at that point? That's it. I needed to rant. I'm sorry if I sound like a spoiled brat. TL:DR: I rely on daca to have an even somewhat decent life. It's being taken away. I'm losing everything.

"My Fictional Home I stared outside, and watched the cold atmosphere awake me. The sunâs rays blocked by the magnificent beauty above us all; an urban scape filling my view around me. I felt a grave sadness strike all in the same spots for my daily routine, crippling what was left of my head. I grabbed the bicycle, and went along the path to any good in my life. âA nearly missed accident up ahead,â I reminded myself. I hit the button to change colors, and awaited a stop that could mean a sour tardiness or a decent morning. The color changed fast, and I hastily sped across the lines between me and the other side. I arrived, striking the pavement at full speed ahead down the rubber sidewalk. A straight path to follow, a new future to envelop soon enough. The fact of the matter was that I had to pray to a god I didnât believe in if I wanted to warp my happy spirit to glorious utopia. Logic overrides hearts quite rarely, leaving a snowflake and a shock of noise behind the mind that just wants it all to change. My bored mind only somewhat consciously bobbed his head around from side to side, keeping an eye on the reflective sign for a change of heart. The observant man coming by on a bicycle or on his own two legs could notice the hurting expression that shone on my face. An insomnia that has outlasted its course, half a heart to spare to the one it belongs to, and the tonnes lying on his stubby shoulders. Whether the man is out to care for their dog, the mail, something; they always take a look to glance at the face of a broken child, often not realizing the fine details in the street lights glowing on my frozen cheeks. âWhat did it take to find redemption?â I often wondered, as grand sunlight was walking upstairs to knock the moon off itâs sleepy stool. I sat and watched a beautiful red giant approach, and drew images in mind to flicker about and echo in my concave dome of secrets. As the flickering opportunity ran full speed in front of me, I turned and felt the imagery toss into the incinerator. A great insecurity washed over the industry working ahead up above, slowing me down as I walked in slowly toward the place to call work. I sat the bicycle at itâs rack, hands in pocket as I blinked at the glaring sun. A numbness hit my heart, and for the next eight hours, Iâd lose who I was, only coming back at the rise of a pounding rain. I walked from a distant building, taking the long path to a home that didnât know me. I took the rugged bicycle, and stared up above at the shadowy clouds. I leaned forward over the handlebars, watching the patterns fly past my visions. I lifted up again, opening my voice to play a tune, looking for a face to redeem my little work. I went onward, and stared at the home that forgot me. I walked slowly up, placing the bicycle just where it was, hitting the kickstand which had sacrificed my ankle some. I opened the door, giving a brief greeting. I entered the meeting room of regrets and lost innocence, stroking my hands over what was a cuddly friend. My vision blurred, feeling the great exhaustion from the night prior taking me over. I curled in the corner, feeling the toilets flushing the pent up pains from an earlier disembarkment of a peanut gallery. I hugged the one thing that brought a soothing to my life, and proceeded to let out an ugly sob, trying to remember who everyone was, as I grabbed a broken mirror, staring at who the blurry stranger was in it. I felt myself faint, awaking to two strangers cycling the door between storage and the hands of all waiting for me. âWhat were you thinking?â the woman asked, âWhat did you say?â the man asking. âI donât know.â I responded, lying on my side, as they both awkwardly stepped out, with a cracked expression of what was me walking out. I felt a blankness ride across my body, as I stared upon a wall that reminded me of life. I sat stationary, and buried my head under a recording of a person with nothing left. I held my heart, staring out at the dark that I wanted to escape in. A length that no person dared, but a low that felt necessary. I felt an unnecessary realism flow through me, as my arms folded, feeling a coldness drip down my neck. I got up, and went to the porch of attempting life again. A moon vanished above me, showing a pine away from me only just by some measurements. The bicycle appeared broken on the road, as I walked to what I remember being the last resort in this world. I walked to a reused bench, and stared out at the murky waters that felt like memories. I looked to my left, seeing a young boy sitting in the back of a delinquentâs wagon, and to my right a child amongst a smaller group, enjoying the finer delicacies of life. In between it all, a fool. I cracked my bubbly back, as a soreness hit my veins. I stood slowly, my body tossing and turning inside. The world turned askew, as the sun beat slowly onto my flustered body. I took flight across the ramp of a broken dream, taking a flip that would ruin me for a day. A nostalgia for the life that was simple broke me down slowly, as I felt my walking slow down. I sat by a curb, watching a teenager go away from a regretful sunset on a bench. He sported a terrible frown, forgetting of the one. A light flew by at

"Just a vent post I went grocery shopping with my mom. I manged to get on the topic of politics and I mentioned how it would be bad if people could start discriminating against someone because of their religious freedom. She told me it should be okay to do this (brought up the whole baker thing to prove her point) while saying this she told me she loved me, but didn't like how I'm gay (pansexual with some hints of genderfluid, though she doesn't know the last part) because it's a sin. I've always wanted my mom's approval, I want it so badly, I want her to turn to me and say she is proud of me..but since I was a kid she always got my hopes up, she always left me to chase after her next boyfriend. The day she left my dad I ran after her car...I don't remember how young I was. I hated her for a long time...I still kinda do. When I was self harming and tried to commit suicide she took me to a therapist to try and get my in a inpatient place...she didn't want to deal with me.

"Im a mess and I need to rant. Every so often, I'll find a glimmer of hope and try my hardest to change my life. I'll start exercising and eating healthy, and pushing myself to talk to people, and I'll actually feel pretty good for a few days. Then I just stop. I'll wake up one day and and have absolutely no desire to be healthy anymore and slip right back into feeling like shit and hating myself because I can't commit to the simplest of things. This is probably the fourth time it's happened in the past year. I made some really bad choices today regarding food, which made me feel so much worse because in my eyes, my worth as a human being is directly tied to the shape of my body. Nobody could ever convince me that it's not. This past bought of motivation, I tried to convince myself that I was going to exercise and eat right for the sake of my health, but in the back of my mind, I knew the only real reason was because I wanted to lose weight. And now here I am, completely abandoned diet and exercise and right back into the throws of depression. All I want to do anymore is lay in bed and try to fall asleep. I don't have a job (or the desire to have one) and I lost most of my friends because I never talked to them. I live with my mom who I thought I could talk to about anything, but I feel like I can't tell her about how bad it's gotten. It doesn't help that she tells me everyday that I need to get a job. I know she is right, but it makes me feel like an even bigger piece of garbage because I've never held down a job for more than 4 months. If I got a job right now, I'd probably have a breakdown and quit the first week. I went through cosmetology school and put myself into debt just to wind up hating the field and trying to lie to myself that I didn't. I thought it was all about doing hair, but it turns out it's all about trying to get people to buy some shitty hair product. I know my outlook on the world is fucked up, but I don't know how to change myself. It's like all these negative thoughts are engraved in the back of my skull. I just feel like I'm stuck and any move I make is the wrong one. Sorry this is all over the place, I'm just really deep into it right now and needed to vent.

"Struggled with depression and anxiety for 3 years and made it through Hi everyone, I just wanted to share my experiences with depression and anxiety in the hope it might give someone else a reason to keep going. Iâm new to reddit, so I hope this is okay! Iâve struggled with severe depression and anxiety for the past three years and itâs honestly been the most difficult thing Iâve ever dealt with. Mental illness is silently crippling. Iâve spent more nights than I can remember wracked with sobs, feeling incredibly alone, and fantasizing about suicide. Iâve spent more days than I can remember feeling hollow, being apathetic, and not caring about what happened to me. Depression is a fucking bitch, and even now, when I actually feel happy and loved and excited for my future, Iâm not naive enough to think that Iâll never have to struggle with my mental health again. But I think I have learned how to best cope with it. Medication didnât work for me, and while I do believe that professional therapy can be invaluable to people struggling with mental illness, it didnât make a big difference in my case. But I learned to focus on the present, to rely on loved ones Iâm lucky enough to have, and to forgive myself. Take it one small step at a time. So what if you couldnât leave your room today? That shitâs fucking hard! You got up and you got out of bed, thatâs the first step. Learn to love yourself even through the despair and self-loathing. There is no one path to overcoming depression, and sometimes itâs not exactly the cure-all you envisioned but rather learning to live with it. But I promise you all that one day, it will be better. You will be happy again. And until then, Iâm happy to listen to you if you ever need anyone to talk to or have any questions.

"Sick of rejection Met someone on an app we seemed to click and talked all night till like 4am, same the next night and the night after that etc. Honestly for the first time in ages I thought Id done it and found someone who liked me aswell and we could hang out and have some fun, even just over the summer Id have been happy with that. After more talking we met, we drove round and spent a few hours just chilling and talking it was fun but something wasnt right. I have these little games I play to kind of 'test the waters', nothing creepy just some fun light flirting like a play full punch to the arm or lean myself a bit closer in watching a video or something, harmless stuff but the reactions tell you the story. Long story short it wasnt the story I was hoping for, nothing was reciprocated and there was just no positive body language (I know im sounding like some sort of socially awkward overly analytical weirdo here but trust me its just the best way I can describe it over text). So it gets to nearly 11 he starts yawning talking about being up for work, fair enough weve been out 4 hours so I drop him home, says text me when you get back so I do and sure enough the generic one word 'haha' responses start and that was it. The thing is its not the first time, it happens all the time, I rarely find anyone who actually has proper chat with me (always just 'fuck now dude?' or that type of crap) so I start getting feelings and they seem to like me, we meet and it all seems to fall apart aftwerwards. Your just gonna have to trust me that im not creepy, I dont make sexual advances, I can hold convo, make people laugh, everyone always seems happy to spend a good few hours with me and not want to go home yet when they do it all comes crashing down. Wtf is wrong with me :/

"Looking for an opinion So I have been angry for awhile now, and I feel like my anger is unjustified. A few weeks, I told one of my close friends that I had feelings for her, and I also told her I wanted some space to get over these feelings. This is because I couldn't be with her. She has a significant other. Soon after, she wouldn't talk to me at all, and she avoided me. All of her friends told me that I shouldn't have done that because it was a bad thing to do. I just wanted to tell her that I wanted some space from her, so I could no longer have feelings for her. Since then, all of her friends, have treated me with aggression and insults. I get dismissed every time I'm around her and all of her friends. This has launched me into another Depressive episode. I was yelled at by other people and ostracized. I was thinking that what I did wasn't so bad, but maybe I'm wrong. I feel like a bad person. I know this probably ridiculous, but I've also feel like killing myself because being ostracized and dismissed is one of my fears. I have social phobia.

When I can give them support and be a good friend they like me. But I'm not good enough to warrant anything in return I guess. I help my friends when they're sad. Why does nobody want to help me?

"Life is so fucking bullshit You think your family cares about you and would do anything to help you, but that's a fucking lie. Both my parents said they went through a ""deep depression"" that was as bad or worse than mine when they were my age, yet they show 0 interest or care in helping me. I have a sore throat? Oh Jesus go to the walk-in clinic immediately! I say I'm extremely depressed and feel no happiness anymore? Oh yeah we can totally fix that by having a talk every 3 months with you when you have a mental breakdown. I feel like they want me to die since they don't give a flying fuck about my mental state, and when we talk about it they just say shit like I have to be more positive. I've started working out again last week, something I couldn't do for almost a year due to being injured, and I feel nothing from it. I used to love working out so much but now it feels like something that betrayed me, as I'm always gonna be doomed to be skinny because I'm too depressed to have an appetite to eat enough. Fuck sakes I hate my life that's slowly being wasted everyday. I dreamt of being a famous celebrity, but instead I'm here.

"Does anyone else get very irritable whenever you're hungry? The biggest problem in my life is that I get extremely irritable when I'm hungry. I'll find myself fantasizing about getting in argument or getting mad about something and then kinda snap out of it and realize I'm actually just hungry. Then I get something to eat and I can feel some of the stress melting away, taking deep breaths and shit. This happens every day. This makes me pretty cranky while I'm making something to eat in the kitchen. If anyone tries to talk to me I just want nothing to do with them until I get some food in me. It's putting a real strain on some of my relationships. I'm struggling with this because it's really hard to balance not overeating with not being irritable. I don't really know whats going on.

"Coursemate [19F] wants me [18F] to find potential housemates, has high demands but iâm doing all the work :/ So at uni itâs time for students to be looking for a house to rent for the next academic year. Usually people live with friends theyâve made and such or just go on facebook and join groups. The place weâre interested in is a 6 bedroom house, I personally wouldnât mind an all female house or with 2 boys and 4 girls idc. But my coursemate said sheâd prefer 3 girls and 3 boys. Well so far we have 4 confirmed girls (me, coursemate and a girl that SHE found), iâm currently getting enquiries from girls and a few guys but if iâm doing this on a first come first served basis, itâs looking to be an all girls house. She made me look for the house, call the agent, book an appointment, put an ad on facebook.... She said that she has some anxieties doing some of this which i guess i can understand bc sometimes i have bouts of social anxiety that i canât help so i am a little sympathetic... But sheâs being very demanding, i couldnât look at any houses over the weekend bc i was with my boyfriends meeting his parents and his family so i couldnât drop all that and go on my laptop doing all of this !! If i tell her that itâs looking to be an all female house with maybe one guy, iâm a little scared to know her reaction... But then again, sheâs made me do all this work and yet would have to audacity to complain ?! I feel like she has a certain demographic in her head of what kind of boys sheâd like in the house (sheâs a lesbian so itâs not like that) ... idk ... Iâm not sure what to do or say... shall i accept the girls that are actually willing to pay and be proactive or decline their offers JUST because my mate âwants boysâð? **TLDR** friend and i need to look for a house with other ppl for next year, sheâs making me do ALL the work, is demanding and wants some boys to live with us. Only girls have been seriously enquiring... how do i tell mate ?

"Iâve been depressed all my life and Iâm just tired Iï¸âm finding it harder and harder everyday. Iâm almost 23 years old and Iï¸ canât even function properly. Iï¸ feel like Iï¸ have the mental capacity of a child sometimes because Iï¸ donât know how to do anything. My entire life Iï¸ lived in fear of my parents and now that Iâm out Iï¸ just canât function at all. Iï¸ had to quit my job because Iï¸ couldnât handle being at work in my emotional state. Iï¸ canât handle people being vaguely negative towards me. I feel awful because now itâs just my fiancÃ© working, but he says that itâs okay that Iï¸ need time.. I canât help but feel he resents me for it. I donât even know how weâre going to pay for our wedding. Iï¸ donât know anything about feminine hygiene, or how to brush/style my hair. Itâs just matted in knots and up in a bun, or if it looks decent enough Iâll put it in a ponytail. Iï¸ donât know how to keep friends because Iï¸ was constantly grounded for everything. Iï¸ spent most of my life alone in my room, when Iï¸ was grounded Iï¸ wasnât allowed to eat dinner with the family. Iï¸ have 2 step sisters, one half sister, and 3 half brothers. All from 3 different marriages not including my parentsâ since Iâm their only child. And Iâm not close with any of them. Iï¸ donât even know all of their ages. Iï¸ didnât have mother figure in my life because my stepmoms were just either physically abusive or emotionally. My dad was a drunk, and just controlled every aspect of my life yelling at me if Iï¸ didnât want to do something or had different opinions than him âyou think youâre in control of your life but youâre not. You belong to meâ or make weird sexual remarks in front of his friend when Iï¸ would have a friend over âoh you two girls are probably going to kiss and rollover on top of each otherâ thankfully not in front of her. But sadly our friendship didnât really last very long. Then he convinced me to get really drunk when Iï¸ went to go visit from college and his friend tried taking advantage of me when Iï¸ was trying to sleep it off in my room. Iï¸ want to get a better job than the one Iï¸ had previously but my upkeep is awful and Iï¸ probably wouldnât get hired.. And Iï¸ know Iï¸ have to better myself but itâs just so hard Iï¸ just donât know where to start. Iï¸ have no money. No friends. Iï¸ practically have no family because Iï¸ never want to go back. Iï¸ dropped out of school because Iï¸ couldnât afford it anymore because my dad stole the money Iï¸ saved up. But even if he didnât Iï¸ probably still wouldâve dropped out because Iï¸ couldnât pick a major, Iï¸ kept changing it, and Iï¸ feel like a loser because Iï¸ was supposed to graduate this year. Iï¸ used to be really good at math and writing and now Iï¸ canât even remember simple math or how to use proper grammar. Iï¸ find myself not knowing how to spell words or using the wrong ones and it just makes me feel so stupid. Iï¸ hate it. Iï¸ was diagnosed with BPD and Iï¸ canât even afford to treat it. My car stopped working, and Iï¸ donât even know how to use a bus. Iï¸ hate my life. Iï¸ hate everything. Iâm just so tired of it all. Iï¸ already went to a mental facility for a month and Iï¸ still canât function. Iï¸ canât bring myself to end it all because Iï¸ love my fiancÃ© more than anything. Heâs been my one true friend since high school, even if we only spoke at school, heâs always been there for me. Iï¸ canât leave him. Iï¸ donât know what to do. I donât have clear thinking. Iï¸ hate that Iâm so black and white, Iâm just trying to be gray. Iâm so sorry this is so long, this is my first post, itâll probably get removed because Iï¸ donât even know how to use reddit but whatever venting this out helps a bit even if no one reads it.

"My friends acting dumb and I donât know what to do? So I have a âfriendâ. Letâs call this âfriendâ B. Iâve known B for most of my school life (we didnât talk from K to 5th grade bc different classes and moving away). In 6th grade she was the only friend I had in academic classes and we both formed a squad (spoiler: it didnât last). Essentially we were very close and have a lot of inside jokes. Starting last April, B started ignoring me after I told her I wanted to do an assignment sheet alone. She took it the wrong way and we ended up fighting the entire break. We made up quickly and life was normal again. Another long ass fight happened over the summer for unknown reason. Then in November, I saw B at Target with someone she hated (lets call her E) at the time (B still does). What pissed me off that B fucking cat-fished E the same week. Again, made up 2 weeks later. Sheâs probably the only friend that actually asks to hang out with me (I have other friends btw). B likes to play these ditching pranks when I would leave then B and her other friends would leave me. Sheâs also destroyed my stuff after I told her no. One of my other friends (letâs call her A) told me that she was obsessed with me that every time when hanging out with B, B would mention me and it creeps me out. I donât know how to deal with the friendship since Iâm scared to deal with B. Any advice? TLDR: My friend is toxic and obsessed with me. I donât know how to break it off without hurting her feelings?

"Went through tough times, friends weren't there, but I still want them in my life. I have 2 best friends from high school since we were young. Long story short, we were the best of friends, had a great friendship and were really good to each other. We are all 19 now, and I went through a bad time the end of last year, my brother was shot in the shoulder as a accident at work, and had alot of issues with my childhood come up. The only difference with my friends and I is that I grew up in a completely different way then they did , I was raised in foster care, that was tough, I grew up poor and had many bad things happen during that time, on the other hand they had very loving parents and a great home. They dont seem to understand some of those things and find it hard to understand why I am the way I am sometimes I need my space and need to be by myself, Being in a foster care that had terrible people in it, I never had celebrated birthdays since a young age, like 3 and when i was 15 was when I found out that they are special days , and so when birthdays do happen I may come across as blunt? Or dont make a massive deal out of it for them sometimes, and they take all of that as I am being blunt and they seem to move away from me and dont make plans with me, same as when my brother was shot, I was a mess, initially they were there for me but eventually they drifted off. But as always we came back together and were just like old times, I know and they know Im a person who likes to deal with things on my own, but I just feel like a burden in their perfect world. I feel like their parents dont like me because of my family history and the way I grew up, I just dont want to always feel like a burden on my friends.

"How can I get out of an almost constant state of dissociation? A majority of the time Iâm just in a state of dissociation. Itâs difficult for me to describe, but itâs like Iâm just not mentally there. Itâs like a constant state of autopilot. Iâm there but my mind isnât. My mind is always so foggy and difficult to navigate through. Most of the time, Iâm just mentally empty. I used to never be like this but I canât remember what life was even like before this. Itâs been like this since I was 14. Iâm 19 now and I want to get out of it badly but I donât know how I can.

"In an awkward situation with my best friend. She wants me to tell how I feel towards her - how should I? Iâve been friends with her for 3 years. Sheâs a lovely person and I really like her, but there were some occasions where I felt weird around her. She apparently sensed it and recently asked me whatâs wrong between us, telling I should tell her if thereâs something. Some of the things Iâm thinking of telling her are: - she often kind of invites herself when she learns I hang out with my friends and invites other people (that I donât know well) as well without asking me when I organise something (picnic, trip etc.) - sheâs a nice person and means well, but she sometimes says things that hurt my feelings. For example, she said she couldnât wait to move into a new flat with her bf or how heâs like in bed when I was having a difficult time after a breakup, and she often assumes Iâm broke and I feel sort of belittled. - she tells my rather personal stuff to her other friends, like gossip I could list several things, but Iâm not sure if I should be upfront, as she has social anxieties and I donât want her to feel bad or scared in social situations. Or are there nicer ways to put them? Also, I should probably mention that I have a small circle of friends, and sheâs basically been my only friend that I get to see regularly, Iâve been really good friends with a girl (B) that I met partly through her for the past few months. I enjoy hanging out with her (A), and we text each other all the time, but Iâm not sure how she (A) feels about this. Thanks for taking your time to read this, I appreciate it.

"Stop and think for a moment It's like stumbling around in the darkness. You can't see, you can only feel. Blinded by the pain of reality. You beg it to stop, as the throbbing in your heart grows stronger. But it's not gonna stop, no matter how hard you beg. Your so called 'friends' abandon You, because your depression talk has gotten too dark. But what's the worst part? That you can't control it? That you can't stop it? Maybe it's the fact that just maybe... just maybe you don't want It to stop. You cling onto your pain, because after all..it's familiar. It's been with you for a while. You stand upon the dark edge, upon the highest edge you could find. You feel the wind blow in your face. You freeze. All the good moments, All the good people. It all comes in floods of part nostalgy and part regret. What took you to this edge? What made you so desperate, To take such drastic action? While the pain is temporary, This thing you're about to do - It's permanent. Stop and think for a moment. Because no matter how long a storm lasts, You still enjoy the rain... You still love the sound of thunder.

"My parentsâ living room is not large enough... My sister and I are visiting our parents this weekend - celebrating a family holiday. Overall itâs been a lot of fun, but this evening, there is a particular tv show that my sister and mom wanted to watch. Sister begged to get the âcomfortable chairâ. Mom and dad are sitting in their respective chairs. My choices are the folding chair or the floor. Also, sisterâs devices are taking up the only proximate outlet, and I only have 10% on my phone battery. I am exhausted - itâs been a fun weekend but there was a lot of planning and I havenât had much sleep. Iâd really prefer to go upstairs to the bedrooms. My mom really wants me to sit with them... but Iâm just too exhausted. I donât want to spend an hour and a half on a folding chair OR on the floor. I donât want to watch this TV show - they can watch it but Iâm just not interested. I especially donât want to spend an hour and a half in an uncomfortable chair, watching a TV show I donât care about, with a dead phone battery. So Iâm in the kitchen right now, with my phone plugged into an outlet. Debating how angry my family will get if I go upstairs and lay down. Debating if I even have enough energy to stay awake for another hour and a half. This is a small thing compared to most of the posts on this board. But dear heaven, Iâm tired...

"Don't know what to do. I have an older sibling who I don't see anymore. Cut a long story short, when she was younger she didn't like the way she was parented and basically reported my parents. She was taken off them and placed into a care setting. She is now a lot older and I have seen her a couple of years ago but we have lost contact all of a sudden. I never use to be allowed to speak to her because apparently she was trouble. But I miss my sister because she is still my sister. She used to always say I could go see her when I'm 16 and my parents can't tell me what to do. What do I do in this situation?

"I'm tired of forcing myself to do things. Maybe it's me being lazy. Maybe it's my undiagnosed ADHD. I don't know. All I know is that I hate not being able to enjoy almost *anything*. I just feel so numb and dull. I dropped almost all of my friendships with people who are not in my workplace. Haven't had the motivation to talk to anyone. It just feels like a chore to me. Socializing is torturous and I get bored very quick. I can't seem to focus on any conversation. I hate forcing myself to do the most simple things, like: taking a shower, putting on makeup, cooking, cleaning, even playing videogames. I'm a huge WoW nerd, so I should be excited for the new patch and game. But, I'm not. I got amped up when I saw the trailer, but now, I rather not play it. I rather not play anything. Just recently, I forced myself to play Bioshock again. It's been years since I visited Rapture. I *love* Rapture. But why is it so boring to play? I used to have so much fun... How do you get out of this funk? I don't want to feel like this and it is ruining my life. Not to mention, my SO and I haven't been doing well because of it. I just feel...nothing. I need help, but I don't want a therapist or any new diet plans. None of that copypaste bullshit. What *actually* works? Also, I forgot to mention that I smoke weed daily. I heard that it can make depression worse and I've been using it for almost two years now. Is this something I should only do at night? I originally used it for sleep.

"Should I have kids? Hereâs why Iâm asking: My mother has an undiagnosed mental illness, of that I am certain. My best guess is either bipolar or borderline personality disorder. Growing up with her was difficult and she never got the help she needed. My brother and I suffered greatly as a result. The scariest thing is when I occasionally find, or think I find, her mental illness in myself.. certain tendencies to obsess, feel abandonment that isnât real and lashing out because of it, etc. When that happens I just feel so disgusting and shameful. In those moments I wish that she wasnât my mom and that I wasnât her son, or that I could permanently swap heads with someone else. I think about all this as my fiancÃ© and I talk about having kids. Both of us are ready and we want to be parents so very badly, though I havenât brought up my fears to her. I worry often about passing on that illness to our children. My fiancÃ© doesnât deserve that, she shouldnât have to face those hard challenges. I love her so much and the thought of doing that to her kills me inside. I feel so much shame around wanting to be a parent because of this that I wonder if I should be one at all, or rather, a biological one. Itâs something Iâve never really thought about before now and I donât know what to do. Please help

"I haven't spoken to my siblings in years I'm 19, and I haven't spoken to my sister and brother in literal years. They live overseas and haven't visited since I was 10. It's not bad emotions or anything, not at all. I just don't call or text and neither do they. I didn't grow up with them, so my other siblings (who live here and I talk to regularly) know them better. I feel left out. I don't want them to think I don't care about them. I feel so bad all the time about it. I know I can just reach out, but I feel awkward doing it. I've tried FB messenger but they don't use it a lot, so now I'm trying to get their WhatsApp info. How should I reach out again? I know this is a weird situation.

"Does anyone care? I have 1 friend but I havenât physically seen them in 7 years but we FaceTime and talk every single day until recently. No big deal Iâm pretty used and expect people to drift out of my life. I know people who I used to be friends with but now we are just accquantences, we donât talk at all but follow each other on social media. But hereâs the thing, when you post things on social media about how you are ready to kill your self or how depressed you are and you donât even get a text asking if youâre okay- does that mean no one cares? I see them caring about other people but they never seen to make sure if Iâm okay. I mean I donât expect them to, but I know when I see people that I care about talking like that I need to make sure that theyâre okay. I mean, how can you say youâre friends with someone but not even say anything when theyâre threatening to kill the selves. Itâs weird, youâll be Sauk g how much you want to die and how depressed you are and no one will say anything BUT theyâll make sure to send you a picture on Snapchat to keep the streak lol. Worthy enough for a number on Snapchat but not worthy enough to live in their eyes Sorry for the rant, just wondering if anyone is expierencing this or idk.

"FIL &amp; BIL literally make themselves at home when they visit I like my home to look nice when guests come over. Sometimes Iâll have a lightly scented candle on in the bathroom or hallway or Iâll turn on a lamp to light up my entryway. The kitchen is always set buffet style to make it easy for everyone to serve themselves. I always make sure to make my guest bedroom is welcoming. Like fluffy pillows, comfy comforter, extra linens, working tv. You get the idea. Whenever my FIL comes to visit it irks TF out of me when he makes these little adjustments while heâs here. I recently noticed that heâll blow out the candle in the bathroom. Like WTF?! I know this cause I went in there before and after him once. Heâll also just randomly walk over to turn off my hallway lamp when heâs only been here for like 20 minutes. A few years ago, when he lived with us for a minute he rearranged my guest bedroom AND would rearrange everything around in my kitchen! Iâm like wtf, I like my keurig right where it is! Thank you! Another wtf, we have a sectional that sits about 7-8 people comfortably when FIL/Bro IL come over they insist on spreading out and lay across the whole damn thing. Do they offer me a seat when I come over? No. Itâs only until my bf scoots over to make room for me so I can squeeze in to sit somewhere at the end of the couch. Oh and bro in law? He always makes sure we know he eats gluten free. FYI he is NOT allergic to gluten and insists that âIf the package doesnât say Gluten Free itâs not gluten free.â Everyone knows not to start that argument with him, thereâs no point. Even if I mention that if my friend who has celiac disease can eat something itâs gluten free. He just shakes his head like idk what Iâm talking about. I donât really say anything cause for 1 FIL is old and for 2 they are both only over a couple times a month. Whatâs the point anyway when I forget all about it the following day? Theyâre here for the SuperBowl and Iâm aggressively writing this as Iâm squished into the corner of my own couch. Would you guys even say anything? What would you say or do? And how much longer is the super bowl?!

"Sister dislikes me. So me and my sister barely speak and barely see each other, but today just made it clear how much she dislikes me. She spoke to everyone but me, I could even see her giving her fiancÃ© looks every time I spoke- I suffer from chronic depression and anxiety so when I tried to speak to my family in the room she would speak over me about something else to that same person I was speaking to. You see, I had an abortion just months before she became pregnant and ever since then she has been off with me. She gives me looks every time I go near her son or even when I attempt to smile at her. I just don't even know anymore. Her son is 2 just to give you a reference of how long it's been. We was fine during my process of going through the abortion but now she just doesn't care to try.

The whole date I felt the overwhelming sense of loneliness I struggle with disappear. My mind was clear and I was able to be quick witted, funny, and upbeat. I was happy for the first time in ages. Now that it's over, I feel worse off. I forgot what it feels like to not be crushed by depression and all the shitty things that come with it. The depression has seeped right back in and it hurts more now. I should be grateful I was able to escape it for a moment, but fuck no.

"Nothing. I just don't want to do anything. Nothing is the only thing that ever sounds good anymore. The stuff I study in school is really cool, but when I get home I just want to lay down and do nothing. Smoking weed makes it easier but I know I'm just pushing my feelings away. I'm just... Tired. And I feel like a bitch because of it. I go to school, work on some homework, go to work, procrastinate homework to get some damn relaxation time, rinse, repeat. I wish I could stop working and just focus on school, cuz it genuinely makes me happy as long as I can dedicate the time to it. But after working I just wanna do nothing. And if I work less hours I just get stressed about paying rent. I don't know if I hate myself or this economy more, but I just wish I could go far away sometimes. Just leave everyone behind and find somewhere to sit and do nothing. Listen to a waterfall crash in the forest, or just look up at a sky that isn't polluted to hell with light. I've been so good lately; Been through this long enough I know why I'm like this. It's February. And February always sucks.

Now,apart from feeling useless and generally thinking that i have no future. I simply don't have any motivation. I know i need to do things, i want to do them, but simply cant gather up motivation or focus to do them. I keep switching between other things, starting to watch videos , only to switch to another one, reading articles, browsing reddit until it's too late to do anything. Then promising i'll do it tomorrow. Worst thing is that i don't really care if i fail. Anyone experienced something similar? TL,DR: Can't gather motivation to do anything, i need to do it, want to do it, but simply can't start doing it. Keep switching between doing other things instead. Anyone has any similar experience?

"Clingy friend So I have a friend who lives pretty far from me. Let me preface this by saying that he has expressed a romantic interest in me, but I am not interested in men, and have told him so. He helped me through a difficult time in my life, and I have thanked him many times for it. I have tried to do the same for him on multiple occasions, but it seems like the more attention I give him, the more he wants. I do not feel that we need to have hour long phone discussions and 26 text messages on a daily basis - I donât talk to ANYONE that much. I started ignoring a text or two here and there, hoping he would catch on. He did, apparently, and we just went about 3 weeks with no contact. Had he sent me a normal text today, I would have answered. Instead, he sent a passive-aggressive âEver since youâre feeling better, you never bother to call me.â This is simply NOT true. I have called him many times when he said he needed to talk, even though I hate talking on the phone. I just simply canât take this level of neediness. Iâm not sure how to explain to him that constant contact drives me nuts and I need space. Every time I try to explain this to him, he seems to feel that it was designed as a personal attack against him. Any thoughts on this? Iâm not going to text him back until Iâve had some time to think about the right thing to say.
